# 50 Pow(x, n)

實現 pow(x, n) ，即計算 x 的整數 n 次冪函數（即，x<sup>n</sup> ）。

##  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Example 1

```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```



### Example 2

```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
```

### Constraints

* -100.0 < x < 100.0
* -2<sup>31</sup> <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup>-1
* n is an integer.
* -10<sup>4</sup> <= x<sup>n</sup> <= 10<sup>4</sup>


### C++ 
```
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        
        while(b != 0){
            int tmpA = a;
            int tmpB = b;
            a = tmpA ^ tmpB;
            b = (unsigned int)(tmpA & tmpB) << 1;
        }

        return a;
    }
}; 
```
