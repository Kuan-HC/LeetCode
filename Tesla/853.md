# 853 車隊

在一條單行道上，有 n 輛車開往同一目的地。目的地是幾英里以外的 target 。

給定兩個整數數組 position 和 speed ，長度都是 n ，其中 position[i] 是第 i 輛車的位置， speed[i] 是第 i 輛車的速度(單位是英里/小時)。

一輛車永遠不會超過前面的另一輛車，但它可以追上去，並與前車 以相同的速度 緊接著行駛。此時，我們會忽略這兩輛車之間的距離，也就是說，它們被假定處於相同的位置。

車隊 是一些由行駛在相同位置、具有相同速度的車組成的非空集合。注意，一輛車也可以是一個車隊。

即便一輛車在目的地才趕上了一個車隊，它們仍然會被視作是同一個車隊。

返回到達目的地的 車隊數量 。

##  Car Fleet

There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.

You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/car-fleet/)


### Example 1

```
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.

```


### Constraints

* n == position.length == speed.length
* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 < target <= 10<sup>6</sup>
* 0 <= position[i] < target
* All the values of position are unique.
* 0 < speed[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup>



### C++ 
```
class Solution {
public:
    int carFleet(int target, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& speed) {
        /*
            將車子依其位置排序，speed也依其變更順序
            之後兩兩相比，若後一台車到台終點的時間比前一台少，代表其會合併
        */
        typedef pair<int,int> iPair;
        int&&len = position.size();
        vector<iPair> posNspeed(len);
        for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i){
            posNspeed[i].first = position[i];
            posNspeed[i].second = speed[i];
        }

        sort(posNspeed.rbegin(), posNspeed.rend());

        /* 第一台車一定會到，先假設他是最慢的*/
        int ret = 1;
        int slowest = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < len; ++i){            
            if(static_cast<uint64_t>(target - posNspeed[slowest].first) * posNspeed[i].second >= static_cast<uint64_t>(target - posNspeed[i].first) * posNspeed[slowest].second){
                continue;
            }
            slowest = i;
            ++ret;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
