# 871 最低加油次數

汽車從起點出發駛向目的地，該目的地位於出發位置東面 target 英里處。

沿途有加油站，用數組 stations 表示。其中 stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] 表示第 i 個加油站位於出發位置東面 positioni 英里處，並且有 fueli 升汽油。

假設汽車油箱的容量是無限的，其中最初有 startFuel 升燃料。它每行駛 1 英里就會用掉 1 升汽油。當汽車到達加油站時，它可能停下來加油，將所有汽油從加油站轉移到汽車中。

為了到達目的地，汽車所必要的最低加油次數是多少？如果無法到達目的地，則返回 -1 。

注意：如果汽車到達加油站時剩余燃料為 0，它仍然可以在那里加油。如果汽車到達目的地時剩余燃料為 0，仍然認為它已經到達目的地。

##   Minimum Number of Refueling Stops

A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the ith gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

### Example 1


```
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
```

### Example 2


```
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).
```


### Constraints

* 1 <= target, startFuel <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* 0 <= stations.length <= 500
* 1 <= positioni < position<sub>i+1</sub> < target
* 1 <= fueli < 10<sup>9</sup>

class Solution

public:
    int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, vector<vector<int>> &stations)
    {
        stations.push_back(vector<int>{target, 0});

        int &&range = move(startFuel);
        int prevPos = 0;
        int retCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < stations.size(); ++i)
        {
            const int &currPos = stations[i][0];
            range -= (currPos - prevPos);

            while (gas.empty() != true && range < 0){
                range += gas.top();
                gas.pop();
                ++retCount;
            }
            
            if (range >= 0){
                gas.push(stations[i][1]);
            }
            prevPos = currPos;
        }

        return range >= 0? retCount : -1;
    }
};
