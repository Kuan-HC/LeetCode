# 1884 雞蛋掉落 - 兩枚雞蛋

給你 2 枚相同 的雞蛋，和一棟從第 1 層到第 n 層共有 n 層樓的建築。

已知存在樓層 f ，滿足 0 <= f <= n ，任何從 高於 f 的樓層落下的雞蛋都 會碎 ，從 f 樓層或比它低 的樓層落下的雞蛋都 不會碎 。

每次操作，你可以取一枚 沒有碎 的雞蛋並把它從任一樓層 x 扔下（滿足 1 <= x <= n）。如果雞蛋碎了，你就不能再次使用它。如果某枚雞蛋扔下後沒有摔碎，則可以在之後的操作中 重覆使用 這枚雞蛋。

請你計算並返回要確定 f 確切的值 的 最小操作次數 是多少？


## Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors

You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.

You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.

In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/egg-drop-with-2-eggs-and-n-floors/)

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.
``` 

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 1000

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int twoEggDrop(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        while (sum < n){
            sum += ++count;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
