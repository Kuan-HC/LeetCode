# 1768 Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

### Example 1

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

### Example 2

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```


### Constraints

* 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
* word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        int&& len1 = word1.length();
        int&& len2 = word2.length();

        string ret;
        int ptr1 = 0;
        int ptr2 = 0;
        while(ptr1 < len1 && ptr2 < len2){
            if(ptr2 < ptr1)
                ret.push_back(word2[ptr2++]);
            else
                ret.push_back(word1[ptr1++]);
        }

        if(ptr1 < len1)
            ret.append(word1.substr(ptr1));
        else
            ret.append(word2.substr(ptr2));

        return ret;
    }

};
