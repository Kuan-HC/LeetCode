### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abccbaacz"
Output: "c"
Explanation:
The letter 'a' appears on the indexes 0, 5 and 6.
The letter 'b' appears on the indexes 1 and 4.
The letter 'c' appears on the indexes 2, 3 and 7.
The letter 'z' appears on the index 8.
The letter 'c' is the first letter to appear twice, because out of all the letters the index of its second occurrence is the smallest.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node is a leaf node and it evaluates to false, so we return false.
```

### Constraints

* 2 <= s.length <= 100
* s consists of lowercase English letters.
* s has at least one repeated letter.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    char repeatedCharacter(string s) {
        vector<bool> cnt(260);
        for(const char& chr : s){
            if(cnt[chr - 'a'] == true)
                return chr;
            cnt[chr - 'a'] = true;
        }

        return ' ';
    }
};
