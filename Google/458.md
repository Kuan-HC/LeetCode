# 458 可憐的小豬

有 buckets 桶液體，其中 正好有一桶 含有毒藥，其余裝的都是水。它們從外觀看起來都一樣。為了弄清楚哪只水桶含有毒藥，你可以喂一些豬喝，通過觀察豬是否會死進行判斷。不幸的是，你只有 minutesToTest 分鐘時間來確定哪桶液體是有毒的。

喂豬的規則如下：

1. 選擇若幹活豬進行喂養
2. 可以允許小豬同時飲用任意數量的桶中的水，並且該過程不需要時間。
3. 小豬喝完水後，必須有 minutesToDie 分鐘的冷卻時間。在這段時間里，你只能觀察，而不允許繼續喂豬。
4. 過了 minutesToDie 分鐘後，所有喝到毒藥的豬都會死去，其他所有豬都會活下來。
5. 重覆這一過程，直到時間用完。

給你桶的數目 buckets ，minutesToDie 和 minutesToTest ，返回 在規定時間內判斷哪個桶有毒所需的 最小 豬數 。

##  Poor Pigs

There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.

You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

1. Choose some live pigs to feed.
2. For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
3. Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
4. After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
5. Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/lemonade-change/)

### Example 1

> Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15  
Output: 2  
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:  
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.  
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:  
>
>- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.  
>- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.  
>- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.  
>- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.  

### Example 2

> Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30  
Output: 2  
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:  
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.  
At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:  
>- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.  
>- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.  
>
>At time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.  

### Constraints

* 1 <= buckets <= 1000
* 1 <= minutesToDie <= minutesToTest <= 100
 


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        // 採用 N 進制來表示各種分配方式
        int&& base = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        int range = 1;
        
        while(range < buckets){
            range *= base;
            ++cnt;
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
