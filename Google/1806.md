# 1806 Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation

You are given an even integer n​​​​​​. You initially have a permutation perm of size n​​ where perm[i] == i​ (0-indexed)​​​​.

In one operation, you will create a new array arr, and for each i:

If i % 2 == 0, then arr[i] = perm[i / 2].
If i % 2 == 1, then arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2].
You will then assign arr​​​​ to perm.

Return the minimum non-zero number of operations you need to perform on perm to return the permutation to its initial value.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-reinitialize-a-permutation/)

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: perm = [0,1] initially.
After the 1st operation, perm = [0,1]
So it takes only 1 operation.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: perm = [0,1,2,3] initially.
After the 1st operation, perm = [0,2,1,3]
After the 2nd operation, perm = [0,1,2,3]
So it takes only 2 operations.
```

 

### Constraints

* 2 <= n <= 1000
* n​​​​​​ is even.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        /*
            計算位置1的值何時會回到原位
            當1的位置在前半段 i，其下一個位置是後i << 1 
            當1的位置在後半段 i，其下一個位置 i << 1 - halfLen + 1
        */
        int halfLen = n >> 1;
        int ret = 0;
        int num1Id = 1;

        do{
            if(num1Id < halfLen)
                num1Id <<= 1;
            else    
                num1Id = (num1Id << 1) - n + 1;
            ++ret;
        }while(num1Id != 1);
        
        return ret;        
    }
};
