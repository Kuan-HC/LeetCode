# 754 Reach a Number

You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target.

You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:

On each move, you can either go left or right.
During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.
Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/reach-a-number/)

### Example 1

```
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).
```
 

### Constraints

* -10<sup>9</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* target != 0

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int reachNumber(int target) {
        int num = 0;
        int cost = 0;
        target = abs(target);

        while(num < target || (target - num) & 1)
            num += ++cost;
        
        return cost;
    }
};
```
