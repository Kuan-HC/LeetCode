# 2315 Count Asterisks

You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-asterisks/)


### Example 1

```
Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
Output: 2
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "iamprogrammer"
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we return 0.
 
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars '|', and asterisks '*'.
* s contains an even number of vertical bars '|'.

### C++

class Solution {
public:
    int countAsterisks(string s) {
        /*
            記録出現bar
            當bar == false時

            當出現bar後
            bar = true
            出現的星號，記錄在另一個tmpCnt
            若有出現bar，則tmpCnt = 0
            bar = false
            最後ret += tmpCnt
        */
        bool bar = false;
        int tmpCnt = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        for(const char& chr : s){
            if(chr == '*'){
                if(bar == true)
                    ++tmpCnt;
                else
                    ++ret;
            } else if(chr == '|'){
                if(bar == false){
                    bar = true;
                } else {
                    bar = false;
                    tmpCnt = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret + tmpCnt;
