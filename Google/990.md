# 990 Satisfiability of Equality Equations

You are given an integer array nums and an array queries where queries[i] = [vali, indexi].

You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters 'a' to 'z'.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.

* For example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".

A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.

### Example 1

```
Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= equations.length <= 500
* equations[i].length == 4
* equations[i][0] is a lowercase letter.
* equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'.
* equations[i][2] is '='.
* equations[i][3] is a lowercase letter.
