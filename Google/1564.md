# 1564 Put Boxes Into the Warehouse I

You are given two arrays of positive integers, boxes and warehouse, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of n rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labelled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where warehouse[i] (0-indexed) is the height of the ith room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:

* Boxes cannot be stacked.
* You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.
* Boxes can only be pushed into the warehouse from left to right only.
* If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.
Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.

### Example 1

<img src="img/1564_1.png" width = "300"/>

```
Input: boxes = [4,3,4,1], warehouse = [5,3,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
```

### Example 2

<img src="img/1564_2.png" width = "300"/>

```
Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]
Output: 3

```
 

### Constraints

* n == warehouse.length
* 1 <= boxes.length, warehouse.length <= 105
* 1 <= boxes[i], warehouse[i] <= 109
