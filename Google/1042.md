# 1042 Flower Planting With No Adjacent

You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n, and an array paths where paths[i] = [xi, yi] describes a bidirectional path between garden xi to garden yi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)th garden. The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* paths[i].length == 2
* 1 <= xi, yi <= n
* xi != yi

        vector<vector<int>> graph(n + 1);

            graph[path[1]].push_back(path[0]);

                used |= 1 << ret[next - 1];
            
            for(int j = 1; j <= 4; ++j){
                if((used & 1 << j) == 0){
                    ret[i] = j;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return ret;
