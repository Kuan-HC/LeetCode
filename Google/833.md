# 833 Find And Replace in String

You are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k.

To complete the ith replacement operation:

1. Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s.
2. If it does not occur, do nothing.
3. Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i].
For example, if s = "abcd", indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = "ab", and targets[i] = "eee", then the result of this replacement will be "eeecd".

All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap.

* For example, a testcase with s = "abc", indices = [0, 1], and sources = ["ab","bc"] will not be generated because the "ab" and "bc" replacements overlap.
Return the resulting string after performing all replacement operations on s.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-and-replace-in-string/)


### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
Explanation:
"a" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"cd" occurs at index 2 in s, so we replace it with "ffff".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeecd"
Explanation:
"ab" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"ec" does not occur at index 2 in s, so we do nothing.
```
 

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* k == indices.length == sources.length == targets.length
* 1 <= k <= 100
* 0 <= indexes[i] < s.length
* 1 <= sources[i].length, targets[i].length <= 50
* s consists of only lowercase English letters.
* sources[i] and targets[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.

            遍歷字符串i
            1.若目前的I小於indices上最接近的
              將該位置的字元加進去
            2.若等於indices上的字元
              檢測是否與sources 相等，相等則將targets加入，同時i + sources[i].length
              不相等時處理如同 1 
            若該位置出現sources[indices[i]]，就替換成targets[i]
