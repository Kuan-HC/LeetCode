# 1893 Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered

You are given a 2D integer array ranges and two integers `left` and `right`. Each `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` represents an inclusive interval between `start`<sub>`i`</sub> and `end`<sub>`i`</sub>.

Return `true` if each integer in the inclusive range `[left, right]` is covered by at least one interval in ranges. Return false otherwise.

An integer x is covered by an interval` ranges[i] = [start`<sub>`i`</sub>, `end`<sub>`i`</sub>`]` if `start`<sub>`i`</sub> <= x <= `end`<sub>`i`</sub>.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/check-if-all-the-integers-in-a-range-are-covered/)

### Example 1

```
Input: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
- 2 is covered by the first range.
- 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
- 5 is covered by the third range.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 is not covered by any range.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= ranges.length <= 50
* 1 <= starti <= endi <= 50
* 1 <= left <= right <= 50


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCovered(vector<vector<int>>& ranges, int left, int right) {
        /*
            差分數組
        */
        vector<int> difference(52);
        for(const vector<int>& range : ranges){
            difference[range[0]]++;
            difference[range[1] + 1]--;
        }

        // rebuild the list
        int val = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i){
            val += difference[i];
            if(i >= left && i <= right && val == 0)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
