You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-69-number/)

### Example 1

>Input: num = 9669  
Output: 9969  
Explanation:   
Changing the first digit results in 6669.  
Changing the second digit results in 9969.  
Changing the third digit results in 9699.  
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666.  
The maximum number is 9969.  

### Example 2
 
>Input: num = 9996    
Output: 9999  
Explanation: Changing the last digit 6 to 9 results in the maximum number.  
 

### Constraints

* 1 <= num <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* num consists of only 6 and 9 digits.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maximum69Number (int num) {
        /*
            將左左往右的第一個6改成9
            如何得到: 由start = 1開始，若比num小, start *= 10 
        */

        int factor = 1;
        while(factor < num)
            factor *= 10;
        
        factor /= 10;
        int copy = num;
        for(; factor > 0; factor/= 10){
            if(copy / factor == 6){
                num += 3 * factor;
                break;
            }
            copy %= factor;
        }

        return num;
    }
};
