# 1913 Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs

The product difference between two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) is defined as (a * b) - (c * d).

For example, the product difference between (5, 6) and (2, 7) is (5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16.
Given an integer array nums, choose four distinct indices w, x, y, and z such that the product difference between pairs (nums[w], nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z]) is maximized.

Return the maximum such product difference.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]
Output: 34
Explanation: We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]
Output: 64
Explanation: We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.
```

### Constraints

* 4 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

        int secLast = INT_MAX;
