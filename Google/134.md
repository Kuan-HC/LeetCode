# 134 加油站

在一條環路上有 n 個加油站，其中第 i 個加油站有汽油 gas[i] 升。

你有一輛油箱容量無限的的汽車，從第 i 個加油站開往第 i+1 個加油站需要消耗汽油 cost[i] 升。你從其中的一個加油站出發，開始時油箱為空。

給定兩個整數數組 gas 和 cost ，如果你可以按順序繞環路行駛一周，則返回出發時加油站的編號，否則返回 -1 。如果存在解，則 保證 它是 唯一 的。


## Single Number II

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

### Example 1

```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
``` 

### Constraints

* n == gas.length == cost.length
* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        /*
            分別記下在每一個站所得到的gas跟走到下一個站的差值
            若要可以走到有一個條件
            1. 差值的總合必需>= 0
            2. 找出一個可以出發的點，第一次計算總值的時候，就紀下最低的數值
               若最低的數值 >= 0 則原始出發點可行，或是最低點的後一點
        */
        int&& len = gas.size();
        int sum = 0;
        int minId = 0;
        int minVal = INT_MAX;

        for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i){
            sum += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if(sum < minVal){
                minId = i;
                minVal = sum;
            }
        }

        if(sum < 0)
            return -1;
       

        return minVal >= 0? 0 : (minId + 1) % len;
    }
};
```
