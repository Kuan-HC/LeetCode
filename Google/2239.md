# 2239 Find Closest Number to Zero

Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.
 

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-closest-number-to-zero/)


### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 1000
* -10<sup>5</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int findClosestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ret = 0;
        int minDist = INT_MAX;
        for(const int& num : nums){
            int&& tmp = abs(num);
            if(tmp < minDist){
                minDist = tmp;
                ret = num;
            } else if(tmp == minDist && num > 0){
                ret = num;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
