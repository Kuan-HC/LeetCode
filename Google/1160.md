# 1160 Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/dota2-senate/)

### Example 1

>Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"  
Output: 6  
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.  

### Example 2

>Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"  
Output: 10  
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.  

### Constraints

* 1 <= words.length <= 1000
* 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
* words[i] and chars consist of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countCharacters(vector<string>& words, string chars) {
        vector<int> cnt(26);
        for(const char& chr : chars)
            ++cnt[chr - 'a'];
        
        int ret = 0;
        vector<int> duplicate;
        for(const string& word : words){
            duplicate.clear();
            duplicate = cnt;
            bool good = true;
            for(const char& chr : word){
                if(--duplicate[chr - 'a'] < 0){
                    good = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(good == true)
                ret += word.length();
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
