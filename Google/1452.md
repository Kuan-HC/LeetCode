# 1452 People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List

Given the array favoriteCompanies where favoriteCompanies[i] is the list of favorites companies for the ith person (indexed from 0).

Return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list of favorites companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/build-an-array-with-stack-operations/)

### Example 1

```
Input: favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["google","microsoft"],["google","facebook"],["google"],["amazon"]]
Output: [0,1,4] 
Explanation: 
Person with index=2 has favoriteCompanies[2]=["google","facebook"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"] corresponding to the person with index 0. 
Person with index=3 has favoriteCompanies[3]=["google"] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"] and favoriteCompanies[1]=["google","microsoft"]. 
Other lists of favorite companies are not a subset of another list, therefore, the answer is [0,1,4].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["leetcode","amazon"],["facebook","google"]]
Output: [0,1] 
Explanation: In this case favoriteCompanies[2]=["facebook","google"] is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=["leetcode","google","facebook"], therefore, the answer is [0,1].
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= favoriteCompanies.length <= 100
* 1 <= favoriteCompanies[i].length <= 500
* 1 <= favoriteCompanies[i][j].length <= 20
* All strings in favoriteCompanies[i] are distinct.
* All lists of favorite companies are distinct, that is, If we sort alphabetically each list then favoriteCompanies[i] != favoriteCompanies[j].
* All strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

                if(i != j && idLists[i].size() <= idLists[j].size()){
                    if(includes(idLists[j].begin(), idLists[j].end(), idLists[i].begin(), idLists[i].end()) == true){

            }

        }

        return ret;
    }
