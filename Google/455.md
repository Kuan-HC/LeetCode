# 455 分發餅乾

假設你是一位很棒的家長，想要給你的孩子們一些小餅幹。但是，每個孩子最多只能給一塊餅幹。

對每個孩子 i，都有一個胃口值 g[i]，這是能讓孩子們滿足胃口的餅幹的最小尺寸；並且每塊餅幹 j，都有一個尺寸 s[j] 。如果 s[j] >= g[i]，我們可以將這個餅幹 j 分配給孩子 i ，這個孩子會得到滿足。你的目標是盡可能滿足越多數量的孩子，並輸出這個最大數值。

##  Assign Cookies

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

### Example 1

> Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.   
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.  
You need to output 1.  

### Example 2

> Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.   
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,   
You need to output 2.

```
class Solution {

        /*
            對g及s排序後使用雙指針

        int gPtr = 0;
        for(int i = 0; gPtr < g.size() && i < s.size(); ++i){
            if(s[i] >= g[gPtr])
