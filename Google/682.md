# 682 棒球比賽

你現在是一場采用特殊賽制棒球比賽的記錄員。這場比賽由若幹回合組成，過去幾回合的得分可能會影響以後幾回合的得分。

比賽開始時，記錄是空白的。你會得到一個記錄操作的字符串列表 ops，其中 ops[i] 是你需要記錄的第 i 項操作，ops 遵循下述規則：

1. 整數 x - 表示本回合新獲得分數 x
2. "+" - 表示本回合新獲得的得分是前兩次得分的總和。題目數據保證記錄此操作時前面總是存在兩個有效的分數。
3. "D" - 表示本回合新獲得的得分是前一次得分的兩倍。題目數據保證記錄此操作時前面總是存在一個有效的分數。
4. "C" - 表示前一次得分無效，將其從記錄中移除。題目數據保證記錄此操作時前面總是存在一個有效的分數。

請你返回記錄中所有得分的總和。

##  Valid Palindrome II

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

* An integer x.  
Record a new score of x.
* '+'.  
Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
* 'D'.  
Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
* 'C'.  
Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.  

Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.

 

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)

### Example 1

> Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]  
Output: 30  
Explanation:  
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].  
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].  
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].  
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].  
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].  
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.  

### Example 2

> Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]  
Output: 27  
Explanation:  
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].  
"-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].  
"4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].  
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].  
"D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].  
"9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].  
"+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].  
"+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].  
The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.  


### Constraints

* 1 <= operations.length <= 1000
* operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or a string representing an integer in the range [-3 * 10<sup>4</sup> , 3 * 10<sup>4</sup> ].
* For operation "+", there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
* For operations "C" and "D", there will always be at least one previous score on the record.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int calPoints(vector<string>& operations) {
        /*
            使用一個vector<int>記錄所有的數字
        */
        vector<int> nums;
        for(const string& str : operations){
            if(str == "C")
                nums.pop_back();
            else if(str == "D")
                nums.push_back(2 * nums.back());
            else if(str == "+")
                nums.push_back(*(nums.end() - 1) + *(nums.end() - 2));
            else
                nums.push_back(stoi(str));        
        }
        
        int ret = 0;
        for(const int& num : nums)
            ret += num ;

        return ret;
    }
};
```
