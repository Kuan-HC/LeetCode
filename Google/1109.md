# 1109 Corporate Flight Bookings

There are n flights that are labeled from 1 to n.

You are given an array of flight bookings bookings, where bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi] represents a booking for flights firsti through lasti (inclusive) with seatsi seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the total number of seats reserved for flight i.

### Example 1

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2   3   4   5
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      20  20
Booking 3 reserved:      25  25  25  25
Total seats:         10  55  45  25  25
Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,2,15]], n = 2
Output: [10,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      15
Total seats:         10  25
Hence, answer = [10,25]
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= bookings.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* bookings[i].length == 3
* 1 <= first<sub>i</sub> <= last<sub>i</sub> <= n
* 1 <= seats<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
        /*
            差分數組
        */
        vector<int> diff(n + 1);
        for(const vector<int>& book : bookings){
            diff[book[0] - 1] += book[2];
            diff[book[1]] -= book[2]; 
        }

        vector<int> ret(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < diff.size() - 1; ++i){
            if(i > 0)
                ret[i] = ret[i - 1];
            ret[i] += diff[i];
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
