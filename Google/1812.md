# 1812 Determine Color of a Chessboard Square

You are given coordinates, a string that represents the coordinates of a square of the chessboard. Below is a chessboard for your reference.

<img src="img/1812.png" width = "350"/>

Return true if the square is white, and false if the square is black.

The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first, and the number second.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/determine-color-of-a-chessboard-square/)

### Example 1

```
Input: coordinates = "a1"
Output: false
Explanation: From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "a1" is black, so return false.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: coordinates = "h3"
Output: true
Explanation: From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "h3" is white, so return true.
```

### Constraints

* coordinates.length == 2
* 'a' <= coordinates[0] <= 'h'
* '1' <= coordinates[1] <= '8'

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool squareIsWhite(string coordinates) {
        int row = coordinates[1] - '1';
        int col = coordinates[0] - 'a';

        return (row & 1) ^ (col & 1); 
    }
};
```
