# 1332 Remove Palindromic Subsequences

You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-69-number/)

### Example 1

>Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step. 

### Example 2
 
>Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
 

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int removePalindromeSub(string s) {
        /*
            重點，只由兩個字等組成
            一次可以移除一個回文子字符串
            e.g. abbabb，一次可以移除 bb_bb, 
            故，不論多長的，最多只要兩次就可以全部
            如果本身就是palindrome就只要 一次
        */
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length() - 1;

        while(left < right){
            if(s[left] == s[right]){
                ++left;
                --right;
            }
            else{
                return 2;
            }
        }

        return 1;
    }
};
