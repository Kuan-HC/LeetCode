# 275 H 指数 II

給你一個整數數組 citations ，其中 citations[i] 表示研究者的第 i 篇論文被引用的次數，citations 已經按照 升序排列 。計算並返回該研究者的 h 指數。

h 指數的定義：h 代表“高引用次數”（high citations），一名科研人員的 h 指數是指他（她）的 （n 篇論文中）總共有 h 篇論文分別被引用了至少 h 次。

請你設計並實現對數時間覆雜度的算法解決此問題。

## H-Index II

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in ascending order, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

### Example 1

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
```


### Constraints

* n == citations.length
* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
* citations is sorted in ascending order.

### C++ 

O(log n)

            nums[mid] >= h
            right = mid  
            第二次 nums[mid] = 1 , 包含1右邊有4個，h = 4
            nums[mid] < h
            left = mid + 1

        int&& len = citations.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = len - 1;
        while(left < right){
            int&& mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1);
            int&& rightSide = len - mid;

            if(citations[mid] >= rightSide)
                right = mid;
            else
                left = mid + 1;
        }

        return len - left;
    }
