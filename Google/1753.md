# 1753 Maximum Score From Removing Stones

You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.

### Example 1

```
Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 7
Explanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.

### Constraints

* 1 <= a, b, c <= 101 <= a, b, c <= 10<sup>5</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        /*
            先對其排序，會用三種情形
            1.最多大 >= 小的兩個相加 e.g.  1 3 5 / 1 4 5
            最高的分數為小的兩個值相加
            2. 小的值相加大於最大 
               1. 差值為偶數 e.g 3  6  7  diff =  3 + 6 - 7 = 2
               小的相自己消耗使其數為變為最大值
               差值 / 2 + 最大值
               2. 差值為奇數 e.g. 4  6  7 diff = 4 + 6 - 7 = 3 
               差值 / 2 + 最大值
        */

        vector<int> nums{a, b, c};
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int&& fewerSum = nums[0] + nums[1];
        if(nums[2] >= fewerSum)
            return fewerSum;
        
        return (fewerSum - nums[2]) / 2 + nums[2];

    }
