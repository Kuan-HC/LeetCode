# 1217 Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position

We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].

We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:

* position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
* position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.

### Example 1

>Input: position = [1,2,3]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1   with cost = 0.  
Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.  
Total cost is 1.  

### Example 2

>Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: We can move the two chips at position  3 to position 2.   Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.  
 

### Constraints

* 1 <= position.length <= 100
* 1 <= position[i] <= 10^9

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostToMoveChips(vector<int>& position) {
        /*
            假設最後的位置x為偶數 則所有偶數位置走過去花費0奇數走過去花費1

        int oddPosCnt = 0;
        int evenPosCnt = 0;
        for(const int& num : position){
            if(num & 1)
                ++oddPosCnt;
            else
                ++evenPosCnt;
        }

        return min(oddPosCnt, evenPosCnt);
    }
};
