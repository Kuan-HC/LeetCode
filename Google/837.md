# 837 New 21 Game

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
```
 

### Constraints

* 0 <= k <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= maxPts <= 10<sup>4</sup>
