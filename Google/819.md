# 819 最常見的單詞

給你一個字符串 paragraph 和一個表示禁用詞的字符串數組 banned ，返回出現頻率最高的非禁用詞。題目數據 保證 至少存在一個非禁用詞，且答案 唯一 。

paragraph 中的單詞 不區分大小寫 ，答案應以 小寫 形式返回。

##  Most Common Word

Given a string `paragraph` and a string array of the banned words `banned`, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.

The words in `paragraph` are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/most-common-word/)

### Example 1

> Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.", banned = ["hit"]  
Output: "ball"  
Explanation:   
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.  
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph.   
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,  
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"),   
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.  

### Example 2

> Input: paragraph = "a.", banned = []  
Output: "a"  


### Constraints

* 1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000
* paragraph consists of English letters, space ' ', or one of the symbols: "!?',;.".
* 0 <= banned.length <= 100
* 1 <= banned[i].length <= 10
* banned[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string mostCommonWord(string paragraph, vector<string>& banned) {
        unordered_set<string>bannedSet(banned.begin(), banned.end());
        unordered_map<string, int> strCnt;
        int most = 0;
        string ret;

        for(int i = 0; i < paragraph.length(); ++i){
            if(isalpha(paragraph[i])){
                string word = "";
                while(i < paragraph.length() && isalpha(paragraph[i])){
                    word.push_back(tolower(paragraph[i++]));
                }
                if(bannedSet.find(word) == bannedSet.end()){
                    strCnt[word]++;
                    if(strCnt[word] > most){
                        most = strCnt[word];
                        ret = move(word);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
