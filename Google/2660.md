# 2660 Determine the Winner of a Bowling Game

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays player1 and player2, representing the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.

The bowling game consists of n turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly 10.

Assume a player hits xi pins in the ith turn. The value of the ith turn for the player is:

* 2xi if the player hits 10 pins in either (i - 1)th or (i - 2)th turn.
* Otherwise, it is xi.

The score of the player is the sum of the values of their n turns.

Return

* 1 if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,
* 2 if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and
* 0 in case of a draw.

### Example 1

```
Input: player1 = [5,10,3,2], player2 = [6,5,7,3]

Output: 1

Explanation:

The score of player 1 is 5 + 10 + 2*3 + 2*2 = 25.

The score of player 2 is 6 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 21.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The score of player 1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.

The score of player 2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.
```


### Constraints

* n == player1.length == player2.length
* 1 <= n <= 1000
* 0 <= player1[i], player2[i] <= 10


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int isWinner(vector<int>& player1, vector<int>& player2) {
        int sum1 = 0;
        int sum2 = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < player1.size(); ++i){
            if((i > 0 && player1[i - 1] == 10) || (i > 1 && player1[i - 2] == 10))
                sum1 += player1[i] << 1;
            else 
                sum1 += player1[i];
            
            if((i > 0 && player2[i - 1] == 10) || (i > 1 && player2[i - 2] == 10))
                sum2 += player2[i] << 1;
            else 
                sum2 += player2[i];
        }

        if(sum1 == sum2)
            return 0;
        
        return sum1 > sum2? 1 : 2;
    }
};
