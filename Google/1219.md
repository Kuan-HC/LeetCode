# 1219 Path with Maximum Gold

In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

* Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
* From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
* You can't visit the same cell more than once.
* Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
* You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.

### Example 1

```
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
```

### Constraints

* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 15
* 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
* There are at most 25 cells containing gold.
