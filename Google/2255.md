# 2255 Count Prefixes of a Given String

You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise only of lowercase English letters.

Return the number of strings in words that are a prefix of `s`.

A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

### Example 1

```
Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
"a", "ab", and "abc".
Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: words = ["a","a"], s = "aa"
Output: 2
Explanation:
Both of the strings are a prefix of s. 
Note that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it should be counted each time.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= words.length <= 1000
* 1 <= words[i].length, s.length <= 10
* words[i] and s consist of lowercase English letters only.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrefixes(vector<string>& words, string s) {
        unordered_map<int, string> prefixMap;
        for(int i = 1; i <= s.length(); ++i)
            prefixMap[i] = s.substr(0, i);

         int ret = 0;
        for(const string& word : words){
            int&& len = word.length();
            if(word == prefixMap[len])
                ++ret;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
