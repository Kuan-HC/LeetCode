# 714 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note:

* You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
* The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.

### Example 1

```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= prices[i] <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 0 <= fee <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>

public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {

            dp.clear();
            dp.resize(2);
            dp[0] = max(prevDp[0], prevDp[1] + prices[i] - fee);
            dp[1] = max(prevDp[1], prevDp[0] - prices[i]);
            prevDp = move(dp);
        }

        return max(prevDp[0], prevDp[1]);
