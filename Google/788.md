An integer x is a good if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from x. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example:

* 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves,
* 2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored),
* 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and
* the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.
Given an integer n, return the number of good integers in the range [1, n].

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/rotated-digits/)

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
```

### Example 2


```
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
```
 

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sub>

### C++ 

```

    int rotatedDigits(int n) {

            while(num > 0){
                int&& dig = num % 10;

                }
            }

                ++ret;
        }

        return ret;
