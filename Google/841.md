# 841 Keys and Rooms

There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.
 

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/keys-and-rooms/)


### Example 1

```
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
```
 

### Constraints

* n == rooms.length
* 2 <= n <= 1000
* 0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
* 1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
* 0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
* All the values of rooms[i] are unique.

    bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
