# 744 尋找比目標字母大的最小字母

給你一個字符數組 letters，該數組按非遞減順序排序，以及一個字符 target。letters 里至少有兩個不同的字符。

返回 letters 中大於 target 的最小的字符。如果不存在這樣的字符，則返回 letters 的第一個字符。

##  Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

### Example 1

<img src="img/733.jpg" width = "400"/>

> Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"  
Output: "c"  
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.  

### Example 2

> Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"  
Output: "f"  
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.  


### Constraints

* 2 <= letters.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
* letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
* letters contains at least two different characters.
* target is a lowercase English letter.


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        /*
            因為是非遞減順予，第一個大於target的，會是最小的
        */
        for(const char& chr : letters){
            if(chr > target)
                return chr;
        }

        return letters[0];
    }
};
