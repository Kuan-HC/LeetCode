# 1940 Longest Common Subsequence Between Sorted Arrays

Given an array of integer arrays arrays where each arrays[i] is sorted in strictly increasing order, return an integer array representing the longest common subsequence among all the arrays.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Example 1

```
Input: arrays = [[1,3,4],
                 [1,4,7,9]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in the two arrays is [1,4].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: arrays = [[2,3,6,8],
                 [1,2,3,5,6,7,10],
                 [2,3,4,6,9]]
Output: [2,3,6]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in all three arrays is [2,3,6].
```

 

### Constraints

* 2 <= arrays.length <= 100
* 1 <= arrays[i].length <= 100
* 1 <= arrays[i][j] <= 100
* arrays[i] is sorted in strictly increasing order.

            if(cnt[i] == arraysLen)
                ret.push_back(i);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
