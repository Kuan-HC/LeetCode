# 521 最長的特殊序列 I

給你兩個字符串 a 和 b，請返回 這兩個字符串中 最長的特殊序列  的長度。如果不存在，則返回 -1 。

「最長特殊序列」 定義如下：該序列為 某字符串獨有的最長子序列（即不能是其他字符串的子序列） 。

字符串 s 的子序列是在從 s 中刪除任意數量的字符後可以獲得的字符串。

例如，"abc" 是 "aebdc" 的子序列，因為刪除 "aebdc" 中斜體加粗的字符可以得到 "abc" 。 "aebdc" 的子序列還包括 "aebdc" 、 "aeb" 和 "" (空字符串)。

## Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.

An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.

A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.

For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).

### Example 1

>Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".  
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.  

### Example 2

> Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".  

### Constraints

* 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100
* a and b consist of lower-case English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int findLUSlength(string a, string b) {    
        if(a != b)
            return max(a.length(), b.length()) ;

        return -1;
    }
};
```
