# 299 猜數字遊戲

你在和朋友一起玩 猜數字（Bulls and Cows）遊戲，該遊戲規則如下：

寫出一個秘密數字，並請朋友猜這個數字是多少。朋友每猜測一次，你就會給他一個包含下述信息的提示：

猜測數字中有多少位屬於數字和確切位置都猜對了（稱為 "Bulls"，公牛），
有多少位屬於數字猜對了但是位置不對（稱為 "Cows"，奶牛）。也就是說，這次猜測中有多少位非公牛數字可以通過重新排列轉換成公牛數字。
給你一個秘密數字 secret 和朋友猜測的數字 guess ，請你返回對朋友這次猜測的提示。

提示的格式為 "xAyB" ，x 是公牛個數， y 是奶牛個數，A 表示公牛，B 表示奶牛。

請注意秘密數字和朋友猜測的數字都可能含有重覆數字。

## Bulls and Cows

You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

* The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
* The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.
 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/bulls-and-cows/)

### Example 1

```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```

### Example 2

```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```


### Constraints

* 1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000
* secret.length == guess.length
* secret and guess consist of digits only.

            else

        int cntB = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < secret.length(); ++i){

                continue;

            int&& num = guess[i] - '0';
            if(record[num] > 0){
                --record[num];
                ++cntB;
            }
        }

        return to_string(cntA) + 'A' + to_string(cntB) + 'B';
    }
