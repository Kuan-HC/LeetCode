# 1523 Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-odd-numbers-in-an-interval-range/)

### Example 1

```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```
 

### Constraints

* 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        /* 
            整理讓計算的部份都為奇數開頭
            若low為奇數 -> (high - low) / 2 + 1
            若low非奇數 -> (high - low - 1) / 2 + 1
        */
        int lowOdd = low & 1? 0 : 1;
        return ((high - low - lowOdd) >> 1) + 1;
    }
};
