# 1184 Distance Between Bus Stops

A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.

### Example 1

<img src="img/1184_1.jpg" width = "250"/>


>Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1    
Output: 1  
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.  

### Example 2

>Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2  
Output: 3  
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.  
 

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10^4
* distance.length == n
* 0 <= start, destination < n
* 0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int distanceBetweenBusStops(vector<int>& distance, int start, int destination) {
        if(start > destination)
            swap(start, destination);

        vector<int> prefix(distance.size() + 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < prefix.size(); ++i)
            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + distance[i - 1];
        
        int&& dist = prefix[destination] - prefix[start];

        return min(dist, prefix.back() - dist);
    }
};
