# 237 刪除鍊表中的節點

有一個單鏈表的 head，我們想刪除它其中的一個節點 node。

給你一個需要刪除的節點 node 。你將 無法訪問 第一個節點  head。

鏈表的所有值都是 唯一的，並且保證給定的節點 node 不是鏈表中的最後一個節點。

刪除給定的節點。注意，刪除節點並不是指從內存中刪除它。這里的意思是：

* 給定節點的值不應該存在於鏈表中。
* 鏈表中的節點數應該減少 1。
* node 前面的所有值順序相同。
* node 後面的所有值順序相同。

## Delete Node in a Linked List


There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.

All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
All the values before node should be in the same order.
All the values after node should be in the same order.
Custom testing:

For the input, you should provide the entire linked list head and the node to be given node. node should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

### Example 1

<img src="img/237_1.jpg" width = "400"/>

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

### Example 2

<img src="img/237_2.jpg" width = "400"/>

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```


### Constraints

* The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [2, 1000].
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
* The value of each node in the list is unique.
* The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node.

    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        node->val = node->next->val;
        node->next = node->next->next;

            tail = node;
            node = node->next;
        }
        tail->next = nullptr;
