# 1221 Split a String in Balanced Strings

Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:

* Each substring is balanced.

Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-cost-to-move-chips-to-the-same-position/)

### Example 1

>Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"  
Output: 4  
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.  

### Example 2

>Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"  
Output: 2  
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.  
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.  
 

### Constraints

* 2 <= s.length <= 1000
* s[i] is either 'L' or 'R'.
* s is a balanced string.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int balancedStringSplit(string s) {
        /*
            當只有兩種元素時，有點像是投票法
            另一個為+另一個為-
        */
        int ret = 0;
        int balance = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i){
            if(s[i] == 'R')
                balance++;
            else
                balance--;
            
            //當在奇數位置時，這個位置應該有多少個R
            if(balance == 0){
                ++ret;
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
