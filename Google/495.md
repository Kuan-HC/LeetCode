# 495 提莫攻擊

在《英雄聯盟》的世界中，有一個叫 “提莫” 的英雄。他的攻擊可以讓敵方英雄艾希（編者注：寒冰射手）進入中毒狀態。

當提莫攻擊艾希，艾希的中毒狀態正好持續 duration 秒。

正式地講，提莫在 t 發起攻擊意味著艾希在時間區間 [t, t + duration - 1]（含 t 和 t + duration - 1）處於中毒狀態。如果提莫在中毒影響結束 前 再次攻擊，中毒狀態計時器將會 重置 ，在新的攻擊之後，中毒影響將會在 duration 秒後結束。

給你一個 非遞減 的整數數組 timeSeries ，其中 timeSeries[i] 表示提莫在 timeSeries[i] 秒時對艾希發起攻擊，以及一個表示中毒持續時間的整數 duration 。

返回艾希處於中毒狀態的 總 秒數。

##  Teemo Attacking

Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.

You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.

Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/teemo-attacking/)

### Example 1

>Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:  
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.  
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.  
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.  

### Example 2

> Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2  
Output: 3  
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:  
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.  
- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.  
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.  


### Constraints

* 1 <= timeSeries.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 10<sup>7</sup>
* timeSeries is sorted in non-decreasing order.

            貪心算法的簡單版
        */

        int left = timeSeries[0];
        int right = timeSeries[0] + duration - 1;
        int sum = 0;

        for(int i = 1; i < timeSeries.size(); ++i){
            const int& time = timeSeries[i];
            if(time > right){
                sum += (right - left + 1);
                left = time;
            }
            right = time + duration - 1;
        }
        sum += (right - left + 1);

        return sum;
    }
};
