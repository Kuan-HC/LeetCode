# 1737 Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions

You are given two strings a and b that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in a or b to any lowercase letter.

Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:

* Every letter in a is strictly less than every letter in b in the alphabet.
* Every letter in b is strictly less than every letter in a in the alphabet.
* Both a and b consist of only one distinct letter.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.

### Example 1

```
Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
Output: 2
Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
Output: 3
Explanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".
```

 

### Constraints

* 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* a and b consist only of lowercase letters.
