### Constraints

* 1 <= a, b <= 1000

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
protected:
    int gcd(int a, int b){
        if(a % b == 0)
            return b;
        
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
public:
    int commonFactors(int a, int b) {
        int&& maxFactor = gcd(a, b);
        int ret = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= maxFactor; ++i){
            if(a % i == 0 && b % i == 0)
                ++ret;
        }

        return ret;        
    }
