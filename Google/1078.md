Given two strings `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some text of the form `"first second third"`, where second comes immediately after first, and third comes immediately after second.

Return an array of all the words third for each occurrence of `"first second third"`.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findOcurrences(string text, string first, string second) {
        /*
            aa good girl, 若查詢a good，會得到girl但其實不符合題意
        */
        stringstream ss(text);
        string prev2Str;
        string prevStr;
        vector<string> ret;

        string subStr;
        while(getline(ss, subStr, ' ')){
            if(prev2Str == first && prevStr == second)
                ret.push_back(subStr);
            
            prev2Str = move(prevStr);
            prevStr = move(subStr);
        }

        return ret;
    }
