# 1184 Day of the Week

[A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance\[i\] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.](1184.md)

```
class Solution {
public:
    string dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
        int days = 0;
        for(int i = 1971; i < year; ++i){
            if((i % 100 != 0 && i % 4 == 0) || i % 400 == 0)
                ++days;
            days+= 365;
        }

        int addDay = ((year % 100 != 0 && year % 4 == 0) || year % 400 == 0)? 1 : 0;
        int months[12] = {31,28 + addDay,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31};

        for(int i = 0; i < month - 1; ++i)
            days += months[i];

        days += day;
        
        vector<string> weekday = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
        int idx = 4; //1971年1月1日為星期五
        idx = (idx + days) % 7;
        
        return weekday[idx];
