# 648 Replace Words

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, when the root "an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

### Example 1

>Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"  
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"  

### Example 2

>Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"  
Output: "a a b c"  

### Constraints

* 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
* 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100
* dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.
* 1 <= sentence.length <= 106
* sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
* The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
* The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
* Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.
* sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.
