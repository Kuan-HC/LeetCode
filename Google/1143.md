# 1143 Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

### Example 1

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
* text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        /*
            標準的dp, 避免出界，加上哨兵符號
        */
        text1.insert(0, " ");
        text2.insert(0, " ");
        vector<int> prevDp(text1.length());
        vector<int> dp;

        for(int ptr2 = 1; ptr2 < text2.length(); ++ptr2){
            dp.resize(text1.length());
            for(int ptr1 = 1; ptr1 < text1.length(); ++ptr1){
                if(text1[ptr1] == text2[ptr2]) 
                    dp[ptr1] = prevDp[ptr1 - 1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[ptr1] = max(prevDp[ptr1], dp[ptr1 - 1]);
            }

            prevDp = move(dp);
        }

        return prevDp.back();
    }
};
