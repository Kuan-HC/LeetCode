# 1004 Max Consecutive Ones III

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)


### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
* 0 <= k <= nums.length

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        /*
            caterpillar method，找 0 的個數 < k + 1的區間 
        */
        int ret = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for(int right = 0, left = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right){
            if(nums[right] == 0)
                ++count;

            while(count > k){
                if(nums[left++] == 0)
                    --count;
            }

            ret = max(ret, right - left + 1);
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
