# 2544 Alternating Digit Sum

You are given a positive integer n. Each digit of n has a sign according to the following rules:

* The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
* Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 521
Output: 4
Explanation: (+5) + (-2) + (+1) = 4.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 111
Output: 1
Explanation: (+1) + (-1) + (+1) = 1.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>9</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int alternateDigitSum(int n) {
        int&& len = to_string(n).length();
        
        int sign = -1;
        if(len & 1)
            sign = 1;

        int ret = 0;
        while(n > 0){
            int&& digit = n % 10 * sign;
            ret += digit;
            n /= 10;
            sign *= -1;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
