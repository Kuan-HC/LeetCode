# 1673 Find the Most Competitive Subsequence

Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]
Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
Output: [2,3,3,4]
```

 

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 109
* 1 <= k <= nums.length

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostCompetitive(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        /*
            目標是要得到長到為K的子序列，且數值要最小
            可以使用一個嚴格遞增棧，當目前的數值比棧頂的數值小
            且 若頂出這一個且可以添加進隊的(還可以用的) 總長度 大於等於K
            就頂出
        */
        int&& len = nums.size();
        vector<int> ret;

        for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i){
            const int& num = nums[i];
            while(ret.empty() != true && ret.back() > num && ret.size() + len - i - 1 >= k)
                ret.pop_back();
            
            if(ret.size() < k)
                ret.push_back(num);            
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
