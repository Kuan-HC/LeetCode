# 636 Exclusive Time of Functions

On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.

Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}". For example, "0:start:3" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and "1:end:2" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.

### Example 1

<img src="img/636.png" width = "300"/>

>Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]  
Output: [3,4]  
Explanation:  
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.  
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.  
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.  
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.  

### Example 2

>Input: n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]  
Output: [8]  
 

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 100
* 1 <= logs.length <= 500
* 0 <= function_id < n
* 0 <= timestamp <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.
* No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.
* Each function has an "end" log for each "start" log.
