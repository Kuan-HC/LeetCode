# 1477 Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

You are given an array of integers arr and an integer target.

You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-two-non-overlapping-sub-arrays-each-with-target-sum/)

### Example 1

```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= arr.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
* 1 <= target <= 10<sup>8</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minSumOfLengths(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        /*
            prefix, hash, DP
            # 因為arr[i]，僅為正數，所以可以不用prefix + hash的方式，改採雙指針
              找出一個窗口[left, right] == target，則找出了一個subarray = right -+ left + 1
              左側的subarray為dp[left - 1], 故距離為subarray + dp[left - 1]
              為方便，dp[0]的初始值為arr.size()
        */
        vector<int> dp(arr.size() + 1);
        dp[0] = arr.size() << 1;
        int ret = INT_MAX;

        for(int right = 0, left = 0, sum = 0; right < arr.size(); ++right){
            sum += arr[right];
            while(sum > target)
                sum -= arr[left++];
            
            if(sum == target){
                int&& len = right - left + 1;
                ret = min(ret, len + dp[left]);
                dp[right + 1] = min(dp[right], len);
            } else {
                dp[right + 1] = dp[right];
            }
        }

        return ret > arr.size()? -1 : ret;
    }
};
