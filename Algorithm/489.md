# 489 掃地機器人

房間（用格柵表示）中有一個掃地機器人。格柵中的每一個格子有空和障礙物兩種可能。

掃地機器人提供4個API，可以向前進，向左轉或者向右轉。每次轉彎90度。

當掃地機器人試圖進入障礙物格子時，它的碰撞傳感器會探測出障礙物，使它停留在原地。

請利用提供的4個API編寫讓機器人清理整個房間的算法。

## Robot Room Cleaner

You are controlling a robot that is located somewhere in a room. The room is modeled as an m x n binary grid where 0 represents a wall and 1 represents an empty slot.

The robot starts at an unknown location in the room that is guaranteed to be empty, and you do not have access to the grid, but you can move the robot using the given API Robot.

You are tasked to use the robot to clean the entire room (i.e., clean every empty cell in the room). The robot with the four given APIs can move forward, turn left, or turn right. Each turn is 90 degrees.

When the robot tries to move into a wall cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle, and it stays on the current cell.

Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using the following APIs:

```
interface Robot {
  // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
  // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.
  boolean move();

  // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
  // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
  void turnLeft();
  void turnRight();

  // Clean the current cell.
  void clean();
}
```
<B>Note</B> that the initial direction of the robot will be facing up. You can assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by a wall.

<B>Custom testing:</B>

The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. You must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must control the robot using only the four mentioned APIs without knowing the room layout and the initial robot's position.

### Example 1

<img src="img/489.jpg" width = "450"/>

```
Input: room = [[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],[1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]], row = 1, col = 3
Output: Robot cleaned all rooms.
Explanation: All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
```

```
class Solution {
private:
    set<pair<int, int>> visted;
    int moves[4][2] = {{-1,0},{0,1},{1,0},{0,-1}};  //順時鐘，上右下左
    void dfs(int x, int y, int dir, Robot& robot)
    {
        robot.clean();
        visted.insert({x,y});

        for(int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
        {
            int&& nextD = (dir + i) % 4;
            int&& nextX = x + moves[nextD][0];
            int&& nextY = y + moves[nextD][1];

            if(visted.find({nextX,nextY}) == visted.end())

                if(robot.move() == true){
                    dfs(nextX, nextY, nextD, robot);
                    //讓機器人回溯
                    robot.turnRight();
                    robot.turnRight();
                    robot.move();
                    robot.turnRight();
                    robot.turnRight();
                }
            }
            robot.turnRight();
        }
    }
public:
    void cleanRoom(Robot& robot) {
        /* 設機器人起始位置為0,0, 向上走讓機器人直行直到碰到障礙物或是已經走過的地區，接著右轉*/
        dfs(0, 0, 0, robot);         
        
    }
};
