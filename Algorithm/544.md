# 544 輸出比賽匹配對

在 NBA 季後賽中，我們總是安排較強的隊伍對戰較弱的隊伍，例如用排名第 1 的隊伍和第 n 的隊伍對決，這是一個可以讓比賽更加有趣的好策略。
現在，給你 n 支隊伍，你需要以字符串格式輸出它們的 最終 比賽配對。

n 支隊伍按從 1 到 n 的正整數格式給出，分別代表它們的初始排名（排名 1 最強，排名 n 最弱）。
我們用括號（'(', ')'）和逗號（','）來表示匹配對——括號（'(', ')'）表示匹配，逗號（','）來用於分割。 在每一輪的匹配過程中，你都需要遵循將強隊與弱隊配對的原則。


## Output Contest Matches

During the NBA playoffs, we always set the rather strong team to play with the rather weak team, like make the rank 1 team play with the rank nth team, which is a good strategy to make the contest more interesting.

Given n teams, return their final contest matches in the form of a string.

The n teams are labeled from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank (i.e., Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team).

We will use parentheses '(', and ')' and commas ',' to represent the contest team pairing. We use the parentheses for pairing and the commas for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode-cn.com/output-contest-matches/)

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 4
Output: "((1,4),(2,3))"
Explanation:
In the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the teams 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.
And we got (1, 4),(2, 3).
In the second round, the winners of (1, 4) and (2, 3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.
And we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).

```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 8
Output: "(((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))"
Explanation:
First round: (1, 8),(2, 7),(3, 6),(4, 5)
Second round: ((1, 8),(4, 5)),((2, 7),(3, 6))
Third round: (((1, 8),(4, 5)),((2, 7),(3, 6)))
Since the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).

```

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string findContestMatch(int n) {
        //動態規劃
        vector<string> preDp(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            preDp[i] = to_string(i + 1);

        while( n != 1)
        {
            int preLen = n;
            n /= 2;
            vector<string> dp(n);
            for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            {
                dp[i] = "(" + preDp[i] + "," + preDp[preLen - i - 1] + ")";
            }
            preDp = move(dp);
        }       
        
        return preDp.front();
    }
};
```
