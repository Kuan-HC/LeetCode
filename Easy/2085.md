# 2085 Count Common Words With One Occurrence

Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-common-words-with-one-occurrence/)

### Example 1

```
Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000
* 1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30
* words1[i] and words2[j] consists only of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countWords(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2) {
        unordered_map<string,int> strCnt1;
        for(const string& str : words1)
            strCnt1[str]++;
        
        unordered_map<string,int> strCnt2;
        for(const string& str : words2){
            if(strCnt1.contains(str) && strCnt1[str] == 1)
                strCnt2[str]++;
        }

        int ret = 0;
        for(const auto&[str, cnt] : strCnt2){
            if(cnt == 1)
                ++ret;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
