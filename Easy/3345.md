# 3345 Smallest Divisible Digit Product I

You are given two integers n and t. Return the smallest number greater than or equal to n such that the product of its digits is divisible by t.
 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/smallest-divisible-digit-product-i/)

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 10, t = 2

Output: 10

Explanation:

The digit product of 10 is 0, which is divisible by 2, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that satisfies the condition.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 15, t = 3

Output: 16

Explanation:

The digit product of 16 is 6, which is divisible by 3, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that satisfies the condition.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 100
* 1 <= t <= 10

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
protected:
    bool divisible( int a, const int& t){
        int product = 1;
        while(a > 0 && product != 0){
            product *= a % 10;
            a /= 10;
        }

        return product % t == 0;
    }
public:
    int smallestNumber(int n, int t) {
        while(divisible(n, t) != true)
            ++n;

        return n;
    }
};
