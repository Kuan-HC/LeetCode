Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substring such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-length-substring-with-two-occurrences/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "bcbbbcba"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".
```

### Constraints

* 2 <= s.length <= 100
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumLengthSubstring(string s) {
        vector<int> cnt(26);
        int overTwice = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        for(int left = 0, right = 0; right < s.length(); ++right){
            if(cnt[s[right] - 'a']++ == 2)
                ++overTwice;
            
            while(overTwice > 0){
                if(--cnt[s[left++] - 'a'] == 2)
                    --overTwice;
            }

            ret = max(ret, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
