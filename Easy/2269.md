# 2269 Find the K-Beauty of a Number

The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

It has a length of k.
It is a divisor of num.
Given integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.

Note:

Leading zeros are allowed.
0 is not a divisor of any value.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

### Example 1

```
Input: num = 240, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "24" from "240": 24 is a divisor of 240.
- "40" from "240": 40 is a divisor of 240.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: num = 430043, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
- "30" from "430043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "00" from "430043": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "04" from "430043": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= num <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* 1 <= k <= num.length (taking num as a string)


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {
        string numStr = to_string(num);
        int ret = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <= numStr.length() - k; ++i){
            string tmpStr = numStr.substr(i, k);
            int tmpNum = stoi(tmpStr);
            if(tmpNum != 0 && num % tmpNum == 0)
                ++ret;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
