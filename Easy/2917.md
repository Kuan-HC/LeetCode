# 2917 Find the K-or of an Array

You are given an integer array nums, and an integer k. Let's introduce K-or operation by extending the standard bitwise OR. In K-or, a bit position in the result is set to 1 if at least k numbers in nums have a 1 in that position.

Return the K-or of nums.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [7,12,9,8,9,15], k = 4

Output: 9

Explanation:

Represent numbers in binary:

Number	Bit 3	Bit 2	Bit 1	Bit 0
7	0	1	1	1
12	1	1	0	0
9	1	0	0	1
8	1	0	0	0
9	1	0	0	1
15	1	1	1	1
Result = 9	1	0	0	1
Bit 0 is set in 7, 9, 9, and 15. Bit 3 is set in 12, 9, 8, 9, and 15.
Only bits 0 and 3 qualify. The result is (1001)2 = 9.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [2,12,1,11,4,5], k = 6

Output: 0

Explanation: No bit appears as 1 in all six array numbers, as required for K-or with k = 6. Thus, the result is 0.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 50
* 0 <= nums[i] < 231
* 1 <= k <= nums.length


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
     int findKOr(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; ++i) {
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int num: nums) {
                if ((num >> i) & 1) {
                    ++cnt;
                }
            }
            if (cnt >= k) {
                ans |= 1 << i;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
