# 2347 Best Poker Hand

You are given an integer array ranks and a character array suits. You have 5 cards where the ith card has a rank of ranks[i] and a suit of suits[i].

The following are the types of poker hands you can make from best to worst:

* "Flush": Five cards of the same suit.
* "Three of a Kind": Three cards of the same rank.
* "Pair": Two cards of the same rank.
* "High Card": Any single card.
Return a string representing the best type of poker hand you can make with the given cards.

Note that the return values are case-sensitive.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/best-poker-hand/)

### Example 1

```
Input: ranks = [13,2,3,1,9], suits = ["a","a","a","a","a"]
Output: "Flush"
Explanation: The hand with all the cards consists of 5 cards with the same suit, so we have a "Flush".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: ranks = [4,4,2,4,4], suits = ["d","a","a","b","c"]
Output: "Three of a Kind"
Explanation: The hand with the first, second, and fourth card consists of 3 cards with the same rank, so we have a "Three of a Kind".
Note that we could also make a "Pair" hand but "Three of a Kind" is a better hand.
Also note that other cards could be used to make the "Three of a Kind" hand.
```

### Constraints

* ranks.length == suits.length == 5
* 1 <= ranks[i] <= 13
* 'a' <= suits[i] <= 'd'
* No two cards have the same rank and suit.


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string bestHand(vector<int>& ranks, vector<char>& suits) {
        vector<int> suitCnt(4);
        int maxSuit = 0;
        for(const char& chr : suits)
            maxSuit = max(maxSuit, ++suitCnt[chr - 'a']);
        
        if(maxSuit == 5)
            return "Flush";
        
        vector<int> rankCnt(14);
        int maxRank = 0;
        for(const int& rank : ranks)
            maxRank = max(maxRank, ++rankCnt[rank]);
        if(maxRank >= 3)
            return "Three of a Kind";
        else if(maxRank >= 2)
            return "Pair";

        
        return "High Card";        
    }
};
