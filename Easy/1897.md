# 1897 Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal

You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).

In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].

Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/redistribute-characters-to-make-all-strings-equal/)

### Example 1

```
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: words = ["ab","a"]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= words.length <= 100
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 100
* words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool makeEqual(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> cnt(26);
        for(const string& word : words){
            for(const char& chr : word)
                cnt[chr - 'a']++;
        }

        int&& len = words.size();
        for(const int& num : cnt){
            if(num % len != 0)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
