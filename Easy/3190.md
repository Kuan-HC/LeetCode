# 3190 Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three

You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.

Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.
 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-child-who-has-the-ball-after-k-seconds/)

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:

Subtract 1 from 1.
Add 1 to 2.
Subtract 1 from 4.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [3,6,9]

Output: 0
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 50
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 50

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ret = 0;
        for(const int& num : nums){
            int&& residual = num % 3;
            ret += min(3 - residual, residual);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
