# 1637 Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

AGiven n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

### Example 1

```
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
``` 

### Constraints

* n == points.length
* 2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* points[i].length == 2
* 0 <= xi, yi <= 10<sup>9</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        auto cmp = [](vector<int>& lhs, vector<int>& rhs){
            if(lhs[0] == rhs[0])
                return lhs[1] < rhs[1];
            return lhs[0] < rhs[0];
        };
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), cmp);
        int ret = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < points.size(); ++i)
            ret = max(ret, points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
