# 1560 Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track

Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).

### Example 1

<img src="img/1560.jpg" width = "300"/>

```
Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: [2]
``` 

### Constraints

* 2 <= n <= 100
* 1 <= m <= 100
* rounds.length == m + 1
* 1 <= rounds[i] <= n
* rounds[i] != rounds[i + 1] for 0 <= i < m

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        /*
            會實際影響計數的只有重起點到終點
        */
        const int& start = rounds.front();
        const int& end = rounds.back();

        vector<int> ret;
        if(end >= start){
            for(int i = start; i <= end; ++i)
                ret.push_back(i);
        } else {
            for(int i = 1; i <= end; ++i)
                ret.push_back(i);
            
            for(int i = start; i <= n; ++i)
                ret.push_back(i);
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
