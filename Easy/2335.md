# 2335 Minimum Amount of Time to Fill Cups

You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up 2 cups with different types of water, or 1 cup of any type of water.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array amount of length 3 where amount[0], amount[1], and amount[2] denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-fill-cups/)

### Example 1

```
Input: amount = [1,4,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup and a warm cup.
Second 2: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 3: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup.
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: amount = [5,4,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
Second 2: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 3: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup, and a hot cup.
Second 5: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
Second 6: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 7: Fill up a hot cup.

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

class Solution {
public:
    int fillCups(vector<int>& amount) {
        sort(amount.begin(), amount.end());
        /*  排序 x y z
            如果 z >= x + y 每一次選Z的時候一定可以選一個x / y

        /*
            若x + y < z 設t = z - (x + y)
            若T為偶數 e.g.  3 5 6 -> T = 3 + 5 - 6 = 2
            先將x及y執行t/2次的清除，得到x + y - (t/2) * 2 = z
            需要 t/2 + z
            再執行Z次即可
            若T為奇數 e.g. 4 5 6 -> T = 4 + 5 - 6 = 3
            執行內部消除t/2，x + y - (t/2) * 2 - 1 = z
            需要t/2 + z + 1
        */
        int&& diff = amount[0] + amount[1] - amount[2];
        if(diff& 1)
            return diff/2 + amount[2] + 1;
        
        return diff/2 + amount[2];
