# 2148 Count Elements With Strictly Smaller and Greater Elements 
Given an integer array nums, return the number of elements that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-elements-with-strictly-smaller-and-greater-elements/)

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* -10<sup>5</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        /*
            扣除掉最大最小值的數量(若有多個)
        */
        int maxVal = INT_MIN;
        int maxCnt = 0;
        int minVal = INT_MAX;
        int minCnt = 0;

        for(const int& num : nums){
            if(num > maxVal){
                maxVal = num;
                maxCnt = 1;
            } else if(num == maxVal){
                maxCnt++;
            }

            if(num < minVal){
                minVal = num;
                minCnt = 1;
            } else if(num == minVal){
                minCnt++;
            }
        }

        if(maxVal == minVal)
            return 0;

        return nums.size() - maxCnt - minCnt;        
    }
