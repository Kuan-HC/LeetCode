# 3353 Minimum Total Operations

Given an array of integers nums, you can perform any number of operations on this array.

In each operation, you can:

Choose a prefix of the array.
Choose an integer k (which can be negative) and add k to each element in the chosen prefix.
A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in arr equal.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,4,2]

Output: 2

Explanation:

Operation 1: Choose the prefix [1, 4] of length 2 and add -2 to each element of the prefix. The array becomes [-1, 2, 2].
Operation 2: Choose the prefix [-1] of length 1 and add 3 to it. The array becomes [2, 2, 2].
Thus, the minimum number of required operations is 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [10,10,10]

Output: 0

Explanation:

All elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* -10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        /*
            每次選擇一個變更，包含該位置及其左側可同樣加減num值
        */
        const int& target = nums.back();
        int sum = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        for(int i = nums.size() - 2; i >= 0; --i){
            int&& diff = target - nums[i];
            if(diff != sum){
                sum += diff - sum;
                nums[i] += sum;
                ++ret;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
