# 2027 Minimum Moves to Convert String

You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.

A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.

Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/number-of-valid-words-in-a-sentence/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
```

### Constraints

* 3 <= s.length <= 1000
* s[i] is either 'X' or 'O'.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoves(string s) {
        /*
            長度為3的移動窗口，但有當第1個為X時，執行轉換的作動
        */
        int ret = 0;
        int&& len = s.length();
        for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i){
            if(s[i] == 'X'){
                i += 2;
                ++ret;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
