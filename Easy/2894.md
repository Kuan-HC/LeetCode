# 2894 Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference

You are given positive integers n and m.

Define two integers as follows:

* num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
* num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.
Return the integer num1 - num2.

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 5, m = 6
Output: 15
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are not divisible by 6 are [1,2,3,4,5], num1 is the sum of those integers = 15.
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are divisible by 6 are [], num2 is the sum of those integers = 0.
We return 15 - 0 = 15 as the answer.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n, m <= 1000


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int num1 = 0;
        int num2 = 0;
        for(int num = 1; num <= n; ++num){
            if(num % m)
                num1 += num;
            else
                num2 += num;
        }
        
        return num1 - num2;
    }
};
