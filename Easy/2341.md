# 2341 Maximum Number of Pairs in Array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:

Choose two integers in nums that are equal.
Remove both integers from nums, forming a pair.
The operation is done on nums as many times as possible.

Return a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation:
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 1 pair has been formed, and there are 0 numbers leftover in nums.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 100


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numberOfPairs(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> cnt(101);
        for(const int& num : nums)
            cnt[num]++;
        
        int pairs = 0;
        for(const int& num : cnt)
            pairs += (num >> 1);
        
        int&& len = nums.size() - (pairs << 1);
        return vector<int>{pairs, len};
    }
};
