# 2319 Check if Matrix Is X-Matrix

A square matrix is said to be an X-Matrix if both of the following conditions hold:

All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero.
All other elements are 0.
Given a 2D integer array grid of size n x n representing a square matrix, return true if grid is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return false.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/check-if-matrix-is-x-matrix/)

### Example 1

```
Input: grid = [[2,0,0,1],[0,3,1,0],[0,5,2,0],[4,0,0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: Refer to the diagram above. 
An X-Matrix should have the green elements (diagonals) be non-zero and the red elements be 0.
Thus, grid is an X-Matrix.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[5,7,0],[0,3,1],[0,5,0]]
Output: false
Explanation: Refer to the diagram above.
An X-Matrix should have the green elements (diagonals) be non-zero and the red elements be 0.
Thus, grid is not an X-Matrix.
```

### Constraints

* n == grid.length == grid[i].length
* 3 <= n <= 100
* 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10<sup>5</sup>


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkXMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        /*
            檢查每個cell
            如判斷其是在對角線上：row == col
            col = len - 1 - row
        */
        int&& len = grid[0].size();
        for(int row = 0; row < grid.size(); ++row){
            for(int col = 0; col < len; ++col){
                if(row == col || col == len - 1 - row){
                    if(grid[row][col] == 0)
                        return false;
                } else {
                    if(grid[row][col] != 0)
                        return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
