# 2937 Make Three Strings Equal

You are given three strings: s1, s2, and s3. In one operation you can choose one of these strings and delete its rightmost character. Note that you cannot completely empty a string.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. If it is impossible to make them equal, return -1.

 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-peaks/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "abb", s3 = "ab"

Output: 2

Explanation: Deleting the rightmost character from both s1 and s2 will result in three equal strings.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s1 = "dac", s2 = "bac", s3 = "cac"

Output: -1

Explanation: Since the first letters of s1 and s2 differ, they cannot be made equal.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s1.length, s2.length, s3.length <= 100
* s1, s2 and s3 consist only of lowercase English letters.


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinimumOperations(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
        /*
            因為至少為2，故第1個字符必定要相等
        */
        if(s1[0] != s2[0] || s2[0] != s3[0] || s1[0] != s3[0])
            return -1;
        int minLen = min({s1.length(), s2.length(), s3.length()});

        int i = 0;
        for(; i < minLen; ++i){
            if(s1[i] != s2[i] || s2[i] != s3[i] || s1[i] != s3[i])
                break;
        }

        return s1.length() - i + s2.length() - i + s3.length() - i;
    }
};
