# 3184 Count Pairs That Form a Complete Day I

Given an integer array hours representing times in hours, return an integer denoting the number of pairs i, j where i < j and hours[i] + hours[j] forms a complete day.

A complete day is defined as a time duration that is an exact multiple of 24 hours.

For example, 1 day is 24 hours, 2 days is 48 hours, 3 days is 72 hours, and so on.
 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-pairs-that-form-a-complete-day-i/)

### Example 1

```
Input: hours = [12,12,30,24,24]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The pairs of indices that form a complete day are (0, 1) and (3, 4).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: hours = [72,48,24,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The pairs of indices that form a complete day are (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= hours.length <= 100
* 1 <= hours[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteDayPairs(vector<int>& hours) {
        /*
            目標：時間複雜度 O(N)
        */
        unordered_map<int, int>residualCnt;
        int ret = 0;
        for(int& hour : hours){
            hour %= 24;
            int&& target = (24 - hour) % 24;
            if(residualCnt.contains(target))
                ret += residualCnt[target];
            residualCnt[hour]++;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
