# 3168 Minimum Number of Chairs in a Waiting Room

You are given a string s. Simulate events at each second i:

* If s[i] == 'E', a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
* If s[i] == 'L', a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.
Return the minimum number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person who enters the waiting room given that it is initially empty.
 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-number-of-chairs-in-a-waiting-room/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "EEEEEEE"

Output: 7

Explanation:

After each second, a person enters the waiting room and no person leaves it. Therefore, a minimum of 7 chairs is needed.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "ELELEEL"

Output: 2
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n, m <= 50
* 1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 50
*1 <= k <= 50

### C++ 

```
1 <= s.length <= 50
s consists only of the letters 'E' and 'L'.
s represents a valid sequence of entries and exits.
