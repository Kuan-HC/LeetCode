# 2644 Find the Maximum Divisibility Score

You are given two integer arrays nums and divisors.

The divisibility score of divisors[i] is the number of indices j such that nums[j] is divisible by divisors[i].

Return the integer divisors[i] with the maximum divisibility score. If multiple integers have the maximum score, return the smallest one.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [2,9,15,50], divisors = [5,3,7,2]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 2 since nums[2] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.

The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 2 since nums[1] and nums[2] are divisible by 3.

The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 0 since none of the numbers in nums is divisible by 7.

The divisibility score of divisors[3] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 2.

As divisors[0], divisors[1], and divisors[3] have the same divisibility score, we return the smaller one which is divisors[3].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since none of numbers in nums is divisible by 5.

The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 1 since only nums[0] is divisible by 2.

The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 3 since nums[2], nums[3] and nums[4] are divisible by 3.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length, divisors.length <= 1000
* 1 <= nums[i], divisors[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDivScore(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& divisors) {
        int ret = 0;
        int maxScore = -1;
        sort(divisors.begin(), divisors.end());
        unordered_set<int> visted;

        for(const int& divNum : divisors){
            if(visted.contains(divNum))
                continue;
            visted.insert(divNum);
            int cnt = 0;
            for(const int& num : nums){
                if(num >= divNum && num % divNum == 0)
                    ++cnt;
            }
            if(cnt > maxScore){
                maxScore = cnt;
                ret = divNum;
            }
        }

        return ret;        
    }
};
