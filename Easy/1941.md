# 1941 Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences

Given a string s, return true if s is a good string, or false otherwise.

A string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).


[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/check-if-all-characters-have-equal-number-of-occurrences/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool areOccurrencesEqual(string s) {
        vector<int> cnt(26);
        for(const char& chr : s)
            cnt[chr - 'a']++;
        
        int base = cnt[s[0] - 'a'];
        for(const int& num : cnt){
            if(num != 0 && num != base)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
