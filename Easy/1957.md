# 1957 Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation:
Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string makeFancyString(string s) {
        int ptr1 = 0;
        int ptr2 = 1;
        int ptr3 = 2;

        while(ptr3 < s.length()){
            if(s[ptr1] == s[ptr2] && s[ptr2] == s[ptr3])
                s[ptr1] = ' ';
            ++ptr1;
            ++ptr2;
            ++ptr3;
        }
        string ret;
        for(const char& chr : s){
            if(chr != ' ')
                ret.push_back(chr);
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
