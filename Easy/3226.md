# 3226 Number of Bit Changes to Make Two Integers Equal

You are given two positive integers n and k.

You can choose any bit in the binary representation of n that is equal to 1 and change it to 0.

Return the number of changes needed to make n equal to k. If it is impossible, return -1.
 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/number-of-bit-changes-to-make-two-integers-equal/)

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 13, k = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
Initially, the binary representations of n and k are n = (1101)2 and k = (0100)2.
We can change the first and fourth bits of n. The resulting integer is n = (0100)2 = k.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 21, k = 21

Output: 0

Explanation:
n and k are already equal, so no changes are needed.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n, k <= 10<sup>6</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minChanges(int n, int k) {
        /*
            只可以把N中的1改成0
            改多少次可以令N->K
            1.當n為0, k為1的時候不行，返-1
        */
        if(k > n)
            return -1;
        
        int ret = 0;
        while(n > 0 || k > 0){
            if((n & 1) == 0 && (k & 1) == 1)
                return -1;
            else if((n & 1) == 1 && (k & 1) == 0)
                ++ret;
            n >>= 1;
            k >>= 1;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
