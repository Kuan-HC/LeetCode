# 3216 Lexicographically Smallest String After a Swap

Given a string s containing only digits, return the 
lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after swapping adjacent digits in s with the same parity at most once.

Digits have the same parity if both are odd or both are even. For example, 5 and 9, as well as 2 and 4, have the same parity, while 6 and 9 do not.

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "45320"

Output: "43520"

Explanation:

s[1] == '5' and s[2] == '3' both have the same parity, and swapping them results in the lexicographically smallest string.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "001"

Output: "001"

Explanation:

There is no need to perform a swap because s is already the lexicographically smallest.
```

### Constraints

* 2 <= s.length <= 100
* s consists only of digits.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(string s) {
        /*
            從前往後找降序，如果能交換，交換後所得會最小
            何時能交換，同時奇/偶數
        */
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; ++i){
            if(s[i] > s[i + 1] && ((s[i] & 1) == (s[i + 1] & 1))){
                swap(s[i], s[i + 1]);
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
