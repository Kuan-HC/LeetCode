# 2595 Number of Even and Odd Bits
You are given a positive integer n.

Let even denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of n with value 1.

Let odd denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of n with value 1.

Note that bits are indexed from right to left in the binary representation of a number.

Return the array [even, odd].

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 50

Output: [1,2]

Explanation:

The binary representation of 50 is 110010.

It contains 1 on indices 1, 4, and 5.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 2

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

The binary representation of 2 is 10.

It contains 1 only on index 1.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 1000


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> evenOddBit(int n) {
        vector<int> ret(2);
        int offset = 0;
        while(n > 0){
            if(n & 1){
                if(offset & 1)
                    ret[1]++;
                else
                    ret[0]++;
            }
            offset++;
            n >>= 1;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
