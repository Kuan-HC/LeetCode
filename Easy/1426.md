# 1426 Counting Elements

Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/counting-elements/)

### Example 1

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there is no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
``` 

### Constraints

* 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
* 0 <= arr[i] <= 1000

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countElements(vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        int ret = 0;
        int prevNum = 0;
        int prevLen = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i){
            const int& base = arr[i];
            int currLen = 0;
            while(i < arr.size() && arr[i] == base){
                ++currLen;
                ++i;
            }
            --i;
            if(base == prevNum + 1)
                ret += prevLen;
            prevNum = base;
            prevLen = move(currLen);
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```
