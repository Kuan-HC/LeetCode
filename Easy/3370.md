### Example 1

```
Input: n = 5

Output: 7

Explanation:

The binary representation of 7 is "111".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 10

Output: 15

```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 1000

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestNumber(int n) {
        int ret = 1;
        while(ret < n){
            ret <<= 1;
            ret |= 1;
        }

        return ret;        
    }
};
