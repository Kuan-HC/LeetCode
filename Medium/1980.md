# 1980 Find Unique Binary String

Given an array of strings nums containing n unique binary strings each of length n, return a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-unique-binary-string/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.
```

### Constraints

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 16
* nums[i].length == n
* nums[i] is either '0' or '1'.
* All the strings of nums are unique.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string>& nums) {
        /*
            康托定理的應用
            長度為N的二進制數，總共應該有2^N- 1個
            數列中只有N個，一定可以找出不存在的
        */
        string ret;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            if(nums[i][i] == '1')
                ret.push_back('0');
            else
                ret.push_back('1');
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
