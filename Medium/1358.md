### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again).

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
```

### Constraints

* 3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
* s only consists of a, b or c characters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int ans = 0, left = 0;
        int cnt[3]{};
        for (char c : s) {
            cnt[c - 'a']++;
            while (cnt[0] && cnt[1] && cnt[2]) {
                cnt[s[left] - 'a']--;
                left++;
            }
            ans += left;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
