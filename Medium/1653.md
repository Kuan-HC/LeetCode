# 1653 Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced

You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* s[i] is 'a' or 'b'​​.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        /*
            要符合要求，不可以有bbbaaa的組合
            可以有以下情形：aaabbb aaaaaa bbbbbb
            動態規劃，每一個位置可以選擇變成a /b
            變成 a: 前方必定是 a, curr == a? 0 : 1
            變成 b: min(前方為 a, 前方為 b) + curr == b? 0 : 1
        */

        int prevA = 0;
        int prevB = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i){
            const char& chr = s[i];
            prevB = min(prevA, prevB) + (chr == 'b'? 0 : 1);
            prevA = prevA + (chr == 'a'? 0 : 1);
        }

        return min(prevA, prevB);
    }
};
