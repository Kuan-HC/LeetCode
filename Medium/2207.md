# 2207 Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String

You are given a 0-indexed string text and another 0-indexed string pattern of length 2, both of which consist of only lowercase English letters.

You can add either pattern[0] or pattern[1] anywhere in text exactly once. Note that the character can be added even at the beginning or at the end of text.

Return the maximum number of times pattern can occur as a subsequence of the modified text.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximize-number-of-subsequences-in-a-string/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: text = "abdcdbc", pattern = "ac"
Output: 4
Explanation:
If we add pattern[0] = 'a' in between text[1] and text[2], we get "abadcdbc". Now, the number of times "ac" occurs as a subsequence is 4.
Some other strings which have 4 subsequences "ac" after adding a character to text are "aabdcdbc" and "abdacdbc".
However, strings such as "abdcadbc", "abdccdbc", and "abdcdbcc", although obtainable, have only 3 subsequences "ac" and are thus suboptimal.
It can be shown that it is not possible to get more than 4 subsequences "ac" by adding only one character.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: text = "aabb", pattern = "ab"
Output: 6
Explanation:
Some of the strings which can be obtained from text and have 6 subsequences "ab" are "aaabb", "aaabb", and "aabbb".
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= text.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* pattern.length == 2
* text and pattern consist only of lowercase English letters.


### C++

        貪心思路，如果要讓pattern[0]配最多，那一定是放在最前面
        反之，要搭配pattern[1]，就是放在最後面，與前方pattern[0]的總合搭配
        我們要算出原本的字符串中有多少個pattern

        long long matches = 0;
        int cnt1 = 0;
        int cnt2 = 0;
        for(const char& chr : text){
            if(chr == pattern[1]){
                matches += cnt1;
                cnt2++;

                cnt1++;
            } 
        }

        return matches + max(cnt1, cnt2);
    }
