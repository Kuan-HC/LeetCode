# 1583 Count Unhappy Friends

You are given a list of preferences for n friends, where n is always even.

For each person i, preferences[i] contains a list of friends sorted in the order of preference. In other words, a friend earlier in the list is more preferred than a friend later in the list. Friends in each list are denoted by integers from 0 to n-1.

All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi] denotes xi is paired with yi and yi is paired with xi.

However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend x is unhappy if x is paired with y and there exists a friend u who is paired with v but:

* x prefers u over y, and
* u prefers x over v.
Return the number of unhappy friends.

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 4, preferences = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0], [3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0]], pairs = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Friend 1 is unhappy because:
- 1 is paired with 0 but prefers 3 over 0, and
- 3 prefers 1 over 2.
Friend 3 is unhappy because:
- 3 is paired with 2 but prefers 1 over 2, and
- 1 prefers 3 over 0.
Friends 0 and 2 are happy.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 2, preferences = [[1], [0]], pairs = [[1, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Both friends 0 and 1 are happy.
```

### Constraints

* 2 <= n <= 500
* n is even.
* preferences.length == n
* preferences[i].length == n - 1
* 0 <= preferences[i][j] <= n - 1
* preferences[i] does not contain i.
* All values in preferences[i] are unique.
* pairs.length == n/2
* pairs[i].length == 2
* xi != yi
* 0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1
* Each person is contained in exactly one pair.

                if(priorityMap[u][x] < priorityMap[u][v]){
                    ++ret;
                    break;
