# 1754 Largest Merge Of Two Strings

You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:

If word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.
For example, if word1 = "abc" and merge = "dv", then after choosing this operation, word1 = "bc" and merge = "dva".
If word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.
For example, if word2 = "abc" and merge = "", then after choosing this operation, word2 = "bc" and merge = "a".
Return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.

A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/largest-merge-of-two-strings/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: word1 = "cabaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
Output: "cbcabaaaaa"
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = "c", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cb", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "caaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cbc", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbca", word1 = "baa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbcab", word1 = "aa", word2 = "aaa"
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abdcaba"
Output: "abdcabcabcaba"
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000
* word1 and word2 consist only of lowercase English letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string largestMerge(string word1, string word2) {
        int&& len1 = word1.size();
        int&& len2 = word2.size();
        int ptr1 = 0;
        int ptr2 = 0;
        string ret;
        while(ptr1 < len1 && ptr2 < len2){
            if(word1[ptr1] > word2[ptr2] || (word1[ptr1] == word2[ptr2] && word1.substr(ptr1) >= word2.substr(ptr2)))
                ret += word1[ptr1++];
            else 
                ret += word2[ptr2++];
        }

        if(ptr1 < len1 || ptr2 < len2)
            ret += ptr1 < len1? word1.substr(ptr1) : word2.substr(ptr2);

        return ret;
    }
};
