# 2390 Removing Stars From a String

You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

In one operation, you can:

* Choose a star in s.
* Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
Return the string after all stars have been removed.

Note:

* The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
* It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5<sup>
* s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
* The operation above can be performed on s.


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        /*
            從右向左掃瞄，記下星號的數量，對應最近的非星號字符數量不加入
        */
        string ret;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i){
            if(s[i] == '*'){
                ++cnt;
            } else {
                if(cnt > 0)
                    --cnt;
                else
                    ret.push_back(s[i]);
            }
        }

        reverse(ret.begin(), ret.end());
        
        return ret;
    }
};
