# 1908 Game of Nim

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with Alice starting first.

In this game, there are n piles of stones. On each player's turn, the player should remove any positive number of stones from a non-empty pile of his or her choice. The first player who cannot make a move loses, and the other player wins.

Given an integer array piles, where piles[i] is the number of stones in the ith pile, return true if Alice wins, or false if Bob wins.

Both Alice and Bob play optimally.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/game-of-nim/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: piles = [1]
Output: true
Explanation: There is only one possible scenario:
- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0].
- On the second turn, there are no stones left for Bob to remove. Alice wins.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: piles = [1,1]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible scenario is:
- On the first turn, Alice removes one stone from the first pile. piles = [0,1].
- On the second turn, Bob removes one stone from the second pile. piles = [0,0].
- On the third turn, there are no stones left for Alice to remove. Bob wins.
```

### Constraints

* n == piles.length
* 1 <= n <= 7
* 1 <= piles[i] <= 7
