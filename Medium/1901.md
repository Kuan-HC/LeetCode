# 1901 Find a Peak Element II

A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

### Example 1

```
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.
```

### Constraints

* m == mat.length
* n == mat[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 500
* 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* No two adjacent cells are equal.


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findPeakGrid(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        /*
            使用二分法，當目前該行的最大值 > 其下一行的相鄰元素(row + 1)
            在left - mid必存在峰值
        */

        int left = 0;
        int right = mat.size() - 1;
        while(left < right){
            int&& row = left + ((right- left) >> 1);
            int&& col = max_element(mat[row].begin(), mat[row].end()) - mat[row].begin();
            if(mat[row][col] > mat[row + 1][col])
                right = row;
            else 
                left = row + 1;
        }
        int&& col = std::ranges::max_element(mat[left]) - mat[left].begin();
        
        return vector<int>{left, col};
    }
};
