# 2415 Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree

Given the root of a perfect binary tree, reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree.

* For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are [2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18], then it should become [18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2].
Return the root of the reversed tree.

A binary tree is perfect if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

### Example 1

<img src="img/2415_1.png" width = "450"/>

```
Input: root = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
Output: [2,5,3,8,13,21,34]
Explanation: 
The tree has only one odd level.
The nodes at level 1 are 3, 5 respectively, which are reversed and become 5, 3.
```

### Example 2

<img src="img/2415_2.png" width = "450"/>

```
Input: root = [7,13,11]
Output: [7,11,13]
Explanation: 
The nodes at level 1 are 13, 11, which are reversed and become 11, 13.
```

### Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2<sup>14<sup>].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 102<sup>5<sup>
* root is a perfect binary tree.
