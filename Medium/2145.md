# 2145 Count the Hidden Sequences

You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].

You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.

* For example, given differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
    * [3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences.
    * [5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6.
    * [1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct.
Return the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0.

### Example 1

```
Input: differences = [1,-3,4], lower = 1, upper = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are:
- [3, 4, 1, 5]
- [4, 5, 2, 6]
Thus, we return 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: differences = [3,-4,5,1,-2], lower = -4, upper = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are:
- [-3, 0, -4, 1, 2, 0]
- [-2, 1, -3, 2, 3, 1]
- [-1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 2]
- [0, 3, -1, 4, 5, 3]
Thus, we return 4.
```

### Constraints

* n == differences.length
* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* -10<sup>5</sup> <= differences[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* -10<sup>5</sup> <= lower <= upper <= 10<sup>5</sup>

        }

        //將minNum移到lower的位置上
        maxNum += lower - minNum;

        return upper - maxNum + 1;
