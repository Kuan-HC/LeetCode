# 1820 Maximum Number of Accepted Invitations

There are m boys and n girls in a class attending an upcoming party.

You are given an m x n integer matrix grid, where grid[i][j] equals 0 or 1. If grid[i][j] == 1, then that means the ith boy can invite the jth girl to the party. A boy can invite at most one girl, and a girl can accept at most one invitation from a boy.

Return the maximum possible number of accepted invitations.

### Example 1

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],
               [1,0,1],
               [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The invitations are sent as follows:
- The 1st boy invites the 2nd girl.
- The 2nd boy invites the 1st girl.
- The 3rd boy invites the 3rd girl.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1,0],
               [1,0,0,0],
               [0,0,1,0],
               [1,1,1,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The invitations are sent as follows:
-The 1st boy invites the 3rd girl.
-The 2nd boy invites the 1st girl.
-The 3rd boy invites no one.
-The 4th boy invites the 2nd girl.
```



### Constraints

* grid.length == m
* grid[i].length == n
* 1 <= m, n <= 200
* grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
