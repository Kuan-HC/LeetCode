# 1798 Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make

You are given an integer array coins of length n which represents the n coins that you own. The value of the ith coin is coins[i]. You can make some value x if you can choose some of your n coins such that their values sum up to x.

Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you can make with your coins starting from and including 0.

Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-number-of-consecutive-values-you-can-make/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: coins = [1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: coins = [1,1,1,4]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
- 2: take [1,1]
- 3: take [1,1,1]
- 4: take [4]
- 5: take [4,1]
- 6: take [4,1,1]
- 7: take [4,1,1,1]
You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
```


### Constraints

* coins.length == n
* 1 <= n <= 4 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= coins[i] <= 4 * 10<sup>4</sup>


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaximumConsecutive(vector<int>& coins) {
        /*
            先將數組排列，
            設目前已達到的最大位置為 x
            如果還沒使用且最小的值 > x + 1
            就無法走到x + 1的位置
        */
        sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
        int val = 0;
        for(const int& coin : coins){
            if(coin > val + 1)
                break;
            val += coin;
        }

        return val + 1;
    }
};
