# 2414 Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring

An alphabetical continuous string is a string consisting of consecutive letters in the alphabet. In other words, it is any substring of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

* For example, "abc" is an alphabetical continuous string, while "acb" and "za" are not.
Given a string s consisting of lowercase letters only, return the length of the longest alphabetical continuous substring.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/length-of-the-longest-alphabetical-continuous-substring/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 4 distinct continuous substrings: "a", "b", "c" and "ab".
"ab" is the longest continuous substring.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: "abcde" is the longest continuous substring.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* s consists of only English lowercase letters.


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestContinuousSubstring(string s) {
        const int& sLen = s.length();
        int ret = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < sLen; ++i){
            int&& prev = s[i] - 'a' - 1;
            int tmpLen = 0;
            while(i < sLen && s[i] - 'a' - prev == 1){
                ++i;
                ++prev;
                ++tmpLen;
            }
            --i;
            ret = max(ret, tmpLen);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
