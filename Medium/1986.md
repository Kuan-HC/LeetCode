# 1986  Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks

There are n tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array tasks of length n, where the ith task takes tasks[i] hours to finish. A work session is when you work for at most sessionTime consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

* If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the same work session.
* You can start a new task immediately after finishing the previous one.
* You may complete the tasks in any order.
Given tasks and sessionTime, return the minimum number of work sessions needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above.

The tests are generated such that sessionTime is greater than or equal to the maximum element in tasks[i].

### Example 1

```
Input: tasks = [1,2,3], sessionTime = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish the first and the second tasks in 1 + 2 = 3 hours.
- Second work session: finish the third task in 3 hours.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: tasks = [3,1,3,1,1], sessionTime = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish all the tasks except the last one in 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 hours.
- Second work session: finish the last task in 1 hour.
```

### Constraints

* n == tasks.length
* 1 <= n <= 14
* 1 <= tasks[i] <= 10
* max(tasks[i]) <= sessionTime <= 15

            本題的數擬範圍相對小，最大為14
            動態規劃：
            1. 先計算出每一種組合的加總，有N個task，組合方式有1 << N
            第i個，與小於1 << i的組合可得i 到 1 << i - 1
            2. 遍曆所有的組合，目前組合state的subset若合小於sessionTime，則可
            dp[state] = dp[state  ^ substate] + 1
            # 如何遍歷所有的subset, 
            e.g. 目前的 state = 11100 , 1. 減去1bit得11011，進行與運算得11000
