# 1711 Count Good Meals

A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers deliciousness where deliciousness[i] is the deliciousness of the i​​​​​​th​​​​​​​​ item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo 109 + 7.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.

### Example 1

```
Input: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.
```


### Constraints

* 1 <= deliciousness.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 2<sup>20</sup>
