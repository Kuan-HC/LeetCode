# 1487 Making File Names Unique

Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name that was previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/making-file-names-unique/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
"fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"
```


### Example 2

```
Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
"gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
"avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= names[i].length <= 20
* names[i] consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and/or round brackets.

        return name + '(' + to_string(i) + ')';
    }

        /*
            記下使用過的名字，以及若之後有相同的名字，其編號
        */
        unordered_map<string, int> fileId;
        vector<string> ret;
        for(const string& name : names){
            if(fileId.contains(name) == false){
                ret.push_back(name);
                fileId[name] = 1;
            } else {
                int id = fileId[name];
                string tmp;
                while(fileId.contains((tmp = addSuffix(name, id))))
                    ++id;
                
                ret.push_back(tmp);
                fileId[name] = ++id;
                fileId[tmp] = 1;
            }
        }

        return ret;
