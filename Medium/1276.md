# 1276 Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients

Given two integers tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices. The ingredients of different burgers are as follows:

* Jumbo Burger: 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
* Small Burger: 2 Tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
Return [total_jumbo, total_small] so that the number of remaining tomatoSlices equal to 0 and the number of remaining cheeseSlices equal to 0. If it is not possible to make the remaining tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices equal to 0 return [].

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/number-of-burgers-with-no-waste-of-ingredients/)

### Example 1

```
Input: tomatoSlices = 16, cheeseSlices = 7
Output: [1,6]
Explantion: To make one jumbo burger and 6 small burgers we need 4*1 + 2*6 = 16 tomato and 1 + 6 = 7 cheese.
There will be no remaining ingredients.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: tomatoSlices = 17, cheeseSlices = 4
Output: []
Explantion: There will be no way to use all ingredients to make small and jumbo burgers.
```

### Constraints

* 0 <= tomatoSlices, cheeseSlices <= 107

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numOfBurgers(int tomatoSlices, int cheeseSlices) {
        /*
            4 tomato 1 cheese
            2 tomato 1 cheese
            要把cheese用光，總共有cheese種burger x jumbo  cheese - x small
            4x + 2(cheese - x) = tomato
            2x = tomato - 2 cheese
        */

        if(tomatoSlices & 1 || tomatoSlices < (cheeseSlices << 1))
            return vector<int>();

        int&& jumbo = ((tomatoSlices - (cheeseSlices << 1)) >> 1);
        if(jumbo > cheeseSlices)
            return vector<int>();

        return vector<int>{jumbo, cheeseSlices - jumbo};
    }
};
