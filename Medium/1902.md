# 1902 Depth of BST Given Insertion Order

You are given a 0-indexed integer array order of length n, a permutation of integers from 1 to n representing the order of insertion into a binary search tree.

A binary search tree is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
* The binary search tree is constructed as follows:

* order[0] will be the root of the binary search tree.
* All subsequent elements are inserted as the child of any existing node such that the binary search tree properties hold.
Return the depth of the binary search tree.

A binary tree's depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1

```
Input: order = [2,1,4,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: order = [2,1,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.
```

### Constraints

* n == order.length
* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* order is a permutation of integers between 1 and n.
