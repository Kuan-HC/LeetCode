# 2464 Minimum Subarrays in a Valid Split

You are given an integer array nums.

Splitting of an integer array nums into subarrays is valid if:

* the greatest common divisor of the first and last elements of each subarray is greater than 1, and
* each element of nums belongs to exactly one subarray.
Return the minimum number of subarrays in a valid subarray splitting of nums. If a valid subarray splitting is not possible, return -1.

Note that:

* The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
* A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [2,6,3,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can create a valid split in the following way: [2,6] | [3,4,3].
- The starting element of the 1st subarray is 2 and the ending is 6. Their greatest common divisor is 2, which is greater than 1.
- The starting element of the 2nd subarray is 3 and the ending is 3. Their greatest common divisor is 3, which is greater than 1.
It can be proved that 2 is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [3,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can create a valid split in the following way: [3] | [5].
- The starting element of the 1st subarray is 3 and the ending is 3. Their greatest common divisor is 3, which is greater than 1.
- The starting element of the 2nd subarray is 5 and the ending is 5. Their greatest common divisor is 5, which is greater than 1.
It can be proved that 2 is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5<sup>
