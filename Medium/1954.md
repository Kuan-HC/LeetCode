# 1954 Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples

In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at every integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate (i, j) has |i| + |j| apples growing on it.

You will buy an axis-aligned square plot of land that is centered at (0, 0).

Given an integer neededApples, return the minimum perimeter of a plot such that at least neededApples apples are inside or on the perimeter of that plot.

The value of |x| is defined as:

x if x >= 0
-x if x < 0

### Example 1

<img src="img/1954.png" width = "300"/>

```
Input: neededApples = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.
However, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside (as depicted in the image above).
The perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: neededApples = 13
Output: 16
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= neededApples <= 10<sup>15</<sup>

### C++ 

```
