# 2028 Find Missing Observations

You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.

You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.

Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.

Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.

### Example 1

```
Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: rolls = [1,5,6], mean = 3, n = 4
Output: [2,3,2,2]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (1 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2) / 7 = 3.
```

### Constraints

* m == rolls.length
* 1 <= n, m <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 <= rolls[i], mean <= 6


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> missingRolls(vector<int>& rolls, int mean, int n) {
        /*
            可以求得總和 - 已知和，可得迷失部份和
            若迷失的和 < n || 迷失的和 > 6 * N   則無法達成
        */
        const int len = rolls.size();
        int&& totalSum = mean * (len + n);
        int&& missSum = totalSum - accumulate(rolls.begin(), rolls.end(), 0);

        if(missSum < n || missSum > 6 * n)
            return {};

        vector<int>ret (n, 1);
        missSum -= n;
        for(int i = 0; i < n && missSum > 0; ++i){
            int fill = min(missSum, 5);
            ret[i] += fill;
            missSum -= fill;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
