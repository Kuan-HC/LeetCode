# 1997 First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms

There are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each day is labeled, starting from 0. You will go in and visit one room a day.

Initially on day 0, you visit room 0. The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n:

* Assuming that on a day, you visit room i,
* if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit a room with a lower or equal room number specified by nextVisit[i] where 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i;
* if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n.
Return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/first-day-where-you-have-been-in-all-the-rooms/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: nextVisit = [0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- On day 0, you visit room 0. The total times you have been in room 0 is 1, which is odd.
  On the next day you will visit room nextVisit[0] = 0
- On day 1, you visit room 0, The total times you have been in room 0 is 2, which is even.
  On the next day you will visit room (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1
- On day 2, you visit room 1. This is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nextVisit = [0,0,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Your room visiting order for each day is: [0,0,1,0,0,1,2,...].
Day 6 is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.
```

### Constraints

* n == nextVisit.length
* 2 <= n <= 105
* 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i

            1. 能抵達目前的房間所要的的日數必定是抵達前一個房間偶數次 + 1
            2. 規則上會當第一次抵達時i，會指定返回的房間j
               要再走到i需要的日子為day[i - 1] - day[j]
            3. 如果抵達房間I時，該房間的需要天數為0，第為第1次到
