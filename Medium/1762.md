# 1762 Buildings With an Ocean View

There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= heights.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 <= heights[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findBuildings(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> ret;
        for(int i = 0; i < heights.size(); ++i){
            while(ret.empty() != true && heights[i] >= heights[ret.back()])
                ret.pop_back();

            ret.push_back(i);
        }

        return ret;   
    }
};
```
