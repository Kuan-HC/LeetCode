# 1927 Sum Game

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

You are given a string num of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in num:

Choose an index i where num[i] == '?'.
Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.
The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.

For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.

* For example, if the game ended with num = "243801", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = "243803", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.
Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice will win and false if Bob will win.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/sum-game/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: num = "5023"
Output: false
Explanation: There are no moves to be made.
The sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half: 5 + 0 = 2 + 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: num = "25??"
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can replace one of the '?'s with '9' and it will be impossible for Bob to make the sums equal.
```

### Constraints

* 2 <= num.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* num.length is even.
* num consists of only digits and '?'.

            1. 如果有奇數個，必定是先手贏
            2. 如果有偶數個，左右對稱的問號可以抵消
               原因是先手的最好決箤是加大差距，後手是減手
                A.  統一將數字較大的放在左邊，若問號都在大的一側，先手必贏
                    因為差距只會加大
                B.  若問號都商小的一側，差距必定為9 x  問號數 / 2
                    這樣不論先手選什麼數字，後手都可以令其變成9
