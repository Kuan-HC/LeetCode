# 2070 Most Beautiful Item for Each Query

You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, beautyi] denotes the price and beauty of an item respectively.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array queries. For each queries[j], you want to determine the maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to queries[j]. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is 0.

Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

### Example 1

```
Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]
Explanation:
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. 
  The maximum beauty among them is 4.
- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].
  The maximum beauty among them is 5.
- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.
  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]
Output: [4]
Explanation: 
The price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4. 
Note that multiple items can have the same price and/or beauty.  
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= items.length, queries.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* items[i].length == 2
* 1 <= pricei, beautyi, queries[j] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

        int maxValue = 0;

            maxValue = max(maxValue, item[1]);
            priceBeauty[item[0]] = maxValue;
        }

                ret.push_back(0);
            else    
                ret.push_back(prev(itr)->second);
        }

        return ret;
    }
