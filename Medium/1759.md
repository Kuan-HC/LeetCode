# 1759 Count Number of Homogenous Substrings

Given a string s, return the number of homogenous substrings of s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
"a"   appears 3 times.
"aa"  appears 1 time.
"b"   appears 2 times.
"bb"  appears 1 time.
"c"   appears 3 times.
"cc"  appears 2 times.
"ccc" appears 1 time.
3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "xy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* s consists of lowercase letters.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countHomogenous(string s) {
        constexpr int MOD = 1E9 + 7;
        uint64_t ret = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i){
            const char& tarChr = s[i];
            int len = 0;
            while(i < s.length() && s[i] == tarChr){
                ++len;
                ++i;
            }
            --i;

            ret += 1ULL * (len + 1) * len >> 1;
            ret %= MOD; 
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
