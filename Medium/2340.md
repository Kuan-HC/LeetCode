# 2340 Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Make a Valid Array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.

Swaps of adjacent elements are able to be performed on nums.

A valid array meets the following conditions:

* The largest element (any of the largest elements if there are multiple) is at the rightmost position in the array.
* The smallest element (any of the smallest elements if there are multiple) is at the leftmost position in the array.
Return the minimum swaps required to make nums a valid array.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-to-make-a-valid-array/)

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,5,3,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Perform the following swaps:
- Swap 1: Swap the 3rd and 4th elements, nums is then [3,4,5,3,5,1].
- Swap 2: Swap the 4th and 5th elements, nums is then [3,4,5,3,1,5].
- Swap 3: Swap the 3rd and 4th elements, nums is then [3,4,5,1,3,5].
- Swap 4: Swap the 2nd and 3rd elements, nums is then [3,4,1,5,3,5].
- Swap 5: Swap the 1st and 2nd elements, nums is then [3,1,4,5,3,5].
- Swap 6: Swap the 0th and 1st elements, nums is then [1,3,4,5,3,5].
It can be shown that 6 swaps is the minimum swaps required to make a valid array.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [9]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array is already valid, so we return 0.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {

    int minimumSwaps(vector<int>& nums) {

            題目要求，將一個最大的元素放在數組的最右邊，
            一個最小的元素放在數組的最左邊
            要求最小夜換次數，也就是移動最小次，
            所以要找出最右的最大值，以及最左邊的最小值
            1. 路徑會不會交錯，會的話，可以省掉一次
