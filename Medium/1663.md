# 1663 Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value

The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string "abe" is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

You are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.

Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 3, k = 27
Output: "aay"
Explanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 5, k = 73
Output: "aaszz"
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* n <= k <= 26 * n

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        /*
            以a: 1, b: 2...
            求長度為n，總分為K的最小字典序字符串
            每一個字符要求，目前可以的最小值:
            目前用 x, 而後面的各位置都不會超過26
            反向思考，每個字如果都是26，會超過目標K diff分
            從前方開始，能扣的分數就是 min(25, diff) 
        */
        
        int&& diff = n * 26 - k;
        string ret;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            int maxDeduct = min(25, diff);
            ret += 'z' - maxDeduct;
            diff -= maxDeduct;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
