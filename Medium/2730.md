# 2730 Find the Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring

You are given a digit string s that consists of digits from 0 to 9.

A string is called semi-repetitive if there is at most one adjacent pair of the same digit. For example, "0010", "002020", "0123", "2002", and "54944" are semi-repetitive while the following are not: "00101022" (adjacent same digit pairs are 00 and 22), and "1101234883" (adjacent same digit pairs are 11 and 88).

Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring of s.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-longest-semi-repetitive-substring/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "52233"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest semi-repetitive substring is "5223". Picking the whole string "52233" has two adjacent same digit pairs 22 and 33, but at most one is allowed.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "5494"

Output: 4

Explanation:

s is a semi-repetitive string.
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 50
* '0' <= s[i] <= '9'


### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(string s) {
        /*
            使用滑動窗口，計算有多少個相鄰字符串
            若新增的與前一個字符一樣，則重覆+1
            若左邊退出的與其右邊的一樣，則-1
        */
        int ret = 0;
        int repeatCnt = 0;
        for(int right = 0, left = 0; right < s.length(); ++right){
            if(right > 0 && s[right] == s[right - 1])
                ++repeatCnt;
            while(repeatCnt > 1){
                if(s[left] == s[left + 1])
                    --repeatCnt;
                ++left;
            }
            ret = max(ret, right - left + 1);
        }

        return ret;   
    }
};
