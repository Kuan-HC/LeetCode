# 1324 Print Words Vertically

Given a string s. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in s.
Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is necessary. (Trailing spaces are not allowed).
Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be only one word.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/print-words-vertically/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
Explanation: Each word is printed vertically. 
 "HAY"
 "ORO"
 "WEU"
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]
Explanation: Trailing spaces is not allowed. 
"TBONTB"
"OEROOE"
"   T"
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 200
* s contains only upper case English letters.
* It's guaranteed that there is only one space between 2 words.

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> printVertically(string s) {
        /*
            將英文字母垂直打印
            1. 需要多少row即為最長的單詞
        */
        stringstream ss(s);
        string word;
        int rowNum = 0;
        vector<string> words;

        while(getline(ss, word, ' ')){
            rowNum = word.length() > rowNum? word.length() : rowNum;
            words.push_back(move(word));
        }

        vector<string> ret(rowNum);
        for(int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i){
            for(int j = 0; j < words[i].length(); ++j){
                int&& dist = i - ret[j].length();
                if(dist > 0)
                    ret[j].append(string(dist, ' '));
                ret[j].push_back(words[i][j]);
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
