# 1968 Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced

You are given a 0-indexed array nums of distinct integers. You want to rearrange the elements in the array such that every element in the rearranged array is not equal to the average of its neighbors.

More formally, the rearranged array should have the property such that for every i in the range 1 <= i < nums.length - 1, (nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2 is not equal to nums[i].

Return any rearrangement of nums that meets the requirements.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/array-with-elements-not-equal-to-average-of-neighbors/description/)

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [6,2,0,9,7]
Output: [9,7,6,2,0]
Explanation:
When i=1, nums[i] = 7, and the average of its neighbors is (9+6) / 2 = 7.5.
When i=2, nums[i] = 6, and the average of its neighbors is (7+2) / 2 = 4.5.
When i=3, nums[i] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (6+0) / 2 = 3.
Note that the original array [6,2,0,9,7] also satisfies the conditions.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,4,5,3]
Explanation:
When i=1, nums[i] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (1+4) / 2 = 2.5.
When i=2, nums[i] = 4, and the average of its neighbors is (2+5) / 2 = 3.5.
When i=3, nums[i] = 5, and the average of its neighbors is (4+3) / 2 = 3.5.
```

### Constraints

* 3 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

### C++ 

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        /*
            我們相將釋字排序
            然後由大到小，奇數位的位子由大到小
            偶數位的位子由小到大
            可得到奇數位的一定大於左右兩邊的數字，不可能為其和的平均值
            偶數位的數子左側一定比他大，左右和的平均若要等於偶數位，右方一定要比較小
            但依剛才的排序方式，奇數位會比偶數位大
        */

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        const int& len = nums.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = len - 1;
        vector<int> ret;
        for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i){
            if(i & 1)
                ret.push_back(nums[right--]);
            else 
                ret.push_back(nums[left++]);
        }

        return ret;        
    }
};
