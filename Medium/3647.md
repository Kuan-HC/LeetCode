# 3647 Maximum Weight in Two Bags

You are given an integer array weights and two integers w1 and w2 representing the maximum capacities of two bags.

Each item may be placed in at most one bag such that:

* Bag 1 holds at most w1 total weight.
* Bag 2 holds at most w2 total weight.
Return the maximum total weight that can be packed into the two bags.

### Example 1

```
Input: weights = [1,4,3,2], w1 = 5, w2 = 4

Output: 9

Explanation:

Bag 1: Place weights[2] = 3 and weights[3] = 2 as 3 + 2 = 5 <= w1
Bag 2: Place weights[1] = 4 as 4 <= w2
Total weight: 5 + 4 = 9
```

### Example 2

```
Input: weights = [3,6,4,8], w1 = 9, w2 = 7

Output: 15

Explanation:

Bag 1: Place weights[3] = 8 as 8 <= w1
Bag 2: Place weights[0] = 3 and weights[2] = 4 as 3 + 4 = 7 <= w2
Total weight: 8 + 7 = 15
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= weights.length <= 100
* 1 <= weights[i] <= 100
* 1 <= w1, w2 <= 300

                        dp[w1Weight][w2Weight] = max(dp[w1Weight][w2Weight], dp[w1Weight - weight][w2Weight] + weight);

                        dp[w1Weight][w2Weight] = max(dp[w1Weight][w2Weight], dp[w1Weight][w2Weight - weight] + weight);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[w1][w2];
    }
