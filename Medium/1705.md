# 1705 Maximum Number of Eaten Apples

There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.

You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.

Given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.

### Example 1

```
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
```


### Constraints

* n == apples.length == days.length
* 1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* days[i] = 0 if and only if apples[i] = 0.

        for(int i = 0; i < apples.size(); ++i){
            if(apples[i] > 0 && days[i] > 0)
                priQue.emplace(days[i] + i, apples[i]);
            
            while(priQue.empty() != true && priQue.top().first <= i)

                    priQue.emplace(data);
            }
        }

        int date = apples.size();
        while(priQue.empty() != true){
            iPair data = priQue.top();
            priQue.pop();
            if(data.first <= date)
                continue;
            int eaten = min(data.first - date, data.second);
            ret += eaten;
            date += eaten;           
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
