# 1914 Cyclically Rotating a Grid

You are given an m x n integer matrix grid​​​, where m and n are both even integers, and an integer k.

The matrix is composed of several layers, which is shown in the below image, where each color is its own layer:

<img src="img/1914_1.png" width = "150"/>

A cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating each layer in the matrix. To cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the counter-clockwise direction. An example rotation is shown below:

### Example 1

```
Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.
```

### Constraints

* maze.length == m
* maze[i].length == n
* 1 <= m, n <= 100
* maze[i][j] is either '.' or '+'.
* entrance.length == 2
* 0 <= entrancerow < m
* 0 <= entrancecol < n
* entrance will always be an empty cell.
